COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS:
**Comprehensive GMP Analysis for Fractal Analytics IPO**

### 1. Current GMP Status
As of the latest available data, the Grey Market Premium (GMP) for Fractal Analytics IPO is ₹0, indicating no premium or discount in the grey market. The issue price band has not been disclosed, making it challenging to determine the expected listing price. Given the lack of GMP, it's neutral, neither positive nor negative.

### 2. Market Sentiment Analysis
The absence of a GMP suggests that the market has not yet fully priced in the expectations for Fractal Analytics IPO. This could indicate a cautious approach from investors, possibly due to the lack of information on the issue price or the company's financials not being fully factored into the market sentiment. The subscription status (oversubscribed or undersubscribed) is not available, but the neutral GMP may suggest a balanced investor confidence level, awaiting more clarity on the issue.

### 3. Listing Gain Potential
Without a clear GMP, it's difficult to estimate the listing gains. Typically, a positive GMP indicates potential for listing gains, but in this case, the GMP is ₹0. The risk-reward assessment is also challenging without knowing the issue price and the expected listing price. Comparison with similar IPOs is not feasible due to the lack of specific GMP data.

### 4. IPO Timeline & Status
The Fractal Analytics IPO is scheduled to open on February 9, 2026, and close on February 11, 2026. The allotment date is set for February 12, 2026, and the IPO is expected to list on February 16, 2026. The current status is "upcoming," and investors should keep an eye on the issue price announcement and subsequent GMP trends for insights into market demand.

### 5. Investment Recommendation
Given the neutral GMP and lack of detailed financial analysis in the provided context, a definitive investment recommendation cannot be made. Investors should await the announcement of the issue price and observe the GMP trend closer to the IPO date to gauge market sentiment better. It's crucial to consider the company's financials, industry outlook, and market conditions before making an investment decision.
