COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS:
**Comprehensive GMP Analysis for Fractal Analytics IPO**

### 1. Current GMP Status
As of the latest update, the Grey Market Premium (GMP) for Fractal Analytics IPO is ₹240, indicating a positive premium. The issue price band is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but the GMP suggests a strong demand for the IPO. The expected listing price can be estimated by adding the GMP to the upper end of the price band, but without the exact price band, we can't calculate this precisely. However, the positive GMP indicates a strong market sentiment towards the IPO.

### 2. Market Sentiment Analysis
The positive GMP of ₹240 indicates high market demand for the Fractal Analytics IPO. This suggests that the IPO is likely to be oversubscribed, given the strong interest from investors. The high GMP also reflects a high level of investor confidence in the company's future prospects. The demand is not only driven by retail investors but also by High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs) and institutional investors, indicating a broad-based interest in the IPO.

### 3. Listing Gain Potential
Based on the GMP, investors can expect significant listing gains. If we assume the issue price is around the lower end of the price band (though not specified), adding the GMP of ₹240 could result in substantial gains on the listing day. However, the actual listing gain will depend on the issue price and the market conditions on the listing day. The risk-reward assessment seems favorable given the strong demand and the company's growth prospects, but investors should also consider the overall market conditions and the sector's performance.

### 4. IPO Timeline & Status
The Fractal Analytics IPO is scheduled to open on February 9, 2026, and close on February 11, 2026. The allotment of shares is expected to be finalized on February 12, 2026, and the IPO is set to list on February 16, 2026. As of now, the IPO is in the pre-opening phase, with the grey market indicating strong demand.

### 5. Investment Recommendation
Given the strong GMP and the positive market sentiment, investors with a short-term perspective may consider applying for this IPO for potential listing gains. However, for long-term investors, it's essential to evaluate the company's fundamentals, growth prospects, and the valuation post-listing. The grey market trends are currently rising, which is a positive sign, but investors should also be aware of the risks associated with IPO investments, including market volatility and the possibility of listing at a price lower than expected.
