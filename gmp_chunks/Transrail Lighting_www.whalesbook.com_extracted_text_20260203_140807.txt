🚩 Risks & Outlook
The primary concern for investors stems from the standalone margin compression, suggesting that while the company is growing its top line aggressively, its cost structure or pricing power may be under pressure in its standalone operations. The exceptional item, though identified as statutory impact, adds a layer of complexity in assessing underlying operational profitability.
The recent acquisition of a 32% equity stake in CEDEC Engineering Private Limited makes it an associate company. This move indicates strategic expansion and integration into the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) segment, which investors will need to monitor for its contribution to future earnings and cash flows.
Geographically, the nine-month revenue split shows a near-equal contribution from India (₹2,402.53 crore) and outside India (₹2,545.97 crore), highlighting a diversified operational base. The company operates under a single segment: EPC.
Investors should watch for margin recovery in the upcoming quarters and any further clarity on the implementation and financial implications of the new Labour Codes.
