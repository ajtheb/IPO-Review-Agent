Chanakya IPO Review – by Paresh Gordhandas, CA & Research Analyst
Particulars
Details
Analyst View
BCL is engaged in the manufacturing, trading and distribution of specialty chemicals. Its product portfolio has 66 products with major range for silicon based products. The company marked growth in its top and bottom lines for the reported periods. The boosted performance in pre-IPO period raise concern. Based on its recent financial data, the issue appears greedily priced. Only well-informed/cash surplus investors may park moderate funds for long term, others may stay away.
Chanakya View
Neutral / Avoid – pricey valuations; only well-informed investors may consider moderate allocation
