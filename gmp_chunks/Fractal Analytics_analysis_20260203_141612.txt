COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS:
**Comprehensive GMP Analysis for Fractal Analytics IPO**

### 1. Current GMP Status
As of the latest update on February 3, 2026, the Grey Market Premium (GMP) for Fractal Analytics IPO is ₹240. This indicates a positive premium, suggesting that the market expects the stock to list at a price higher than the issue price. However, the exact issue price is not provided in the context. Assuming the issue price is within the mentioned IPO price band (though the band is not specified), the GMP percentage would be significantly positive, indicating strong demand.

### 2. Market Sentiment Analysis
The positive GMP of ₹240 indicates strong market demand for the Fractal Analytics IPO. This suggests that the IPO is likely to be oversubscribed, given the high premium in the grey market. Investor confidence seems high, driven by the company's strong financials, with revenue of ₹2,816.20 crores in 2025 and a profit of ₹220.60 crores, indicating a significant turnaround from the loss in 2024. The demand is further fueled by the company's position as a leading global AI and analytics company.

### 3. Listing Gain Potential
Based on the GMP, investors can expect significant listing gains. If the IPO lists at a price that includes the GMP of ₹240, investors who apply at the lower end of the price band could see substantial returns. However, the risk-reward assessment must consider that GMP can fluctuate and does not guarantee listing price performance. Compared to similar IPOs in the technology and analytics sector, Fractal Analytics' GMP suggests it is among the more anticipated listings.

### 4. IPO Timeline & Status
The Fractal Analytics IPO is scheduled to open on February 9, 2026, and close on February 11, 2026. The allotment is expected to be finalized on February 12, 2026, with the listing date set for February 16, 2026. As of the current status, the IPO is upcoming, and investors have a short window to apply.

### 5. Investment Recommendation
Given the strong market sentiment and high GMP, applying for this IPO could be considered, especially for those looking for short-term gains. However, it's crucial to evaluate the company's fundamentals, industry trends, and the overall market condition. The risk factors include the volatility of the grey market, which can change rapidly, and the company's ability to sustain its growth trajectory.

### 6. Key Takeaways
- **Strong Demand**: The high GMP indicates strong demand and potential for oversubscription.
- **Positive Sentiment**: Market sentiment is positive, driven by the company's financial performance and industry leadership.
- **Listing Gains**: Significant listing gains are expected based on current GMP, but this comes with the risk of market volatility.
- **Application Decision**: Investors should carefully consider their investment goals and risk tolerance before applying.
- **Market Watch**: Continuous monitoring of GMP and market trends is advisable for informed decision-making.

In conclusion, while the Fractal Analytics IPO presents an attractive opportunity based on its GMP and market sentiment, potential investors must conduct thorough research and consider all factors before making an application.
