7 Comments on “IPO GMP live updates”
Any scope for further fall in I CICI GMP? I believe FIIs andDIIS will hugely oversubscribe the IPO and then sharp rally expected on listing.
True reporting of ICICI AMC grey market premium. You predicted sharp fall and same patter seen.
Your Chanakya GMP Intelligent is very detailed. Every evening I eagerly await for your report.
The way you have covered Lenskart, Sudeep Pharma and ICICI AMC gmps, it appears that GMP of most of the IPOs start from your network and that may be the reason for such accurate and fast reporting.
Is it true?
In spite of no such fancy in Groww IPO, you were confident about good lising and same patter has been observed. Congrats for your sharp analysis.
Your 8-pm Grey market report is excellent.No website provides such detailed information. Well done.
Adequate subscription not expected in Fujiyama and Capillary, since both IPOs donot have any fancy in the grey market.
Sharp volatility continues in
Tenneco IPO. Bumper listing anticipated.
Some improvement in Physicswalla seen in retail category.
