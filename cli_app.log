Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain specific GMP data for Vidya Wires. However, I will provide a general framework for GMP analysis and highlight the missing information required to conduct a comprehensive analysis.

### 1. Current GMP Status
- **Missing Information:** Current GMP price and percentage for Vidya Wires.
- To assess the current GMP status, we need the GMP price and its percentage relative to the issue price.

### 2. Market Sentiment Analysis
- **Missing Information:** Market demand indicators, such as subscription numbers and investor feedback.
- GMP is a key indicator of market demand. A positive GMP suggests high demand and potential oversubscription, while a negative GMP may indicate low demand.

### 3. Listing Gain Potential

- Listing gain potential can be estimated by comparing the expected listing price (derived from GMP) with the issue price.

### 4. IPO Timeline & Status
- **Missing Information:** Specific dates for the IPO opening, closing, and listing.
- Understanding the IPO timeline is crucial for potential investors to plan their applications and expectations.

### 5. Investment Recommendation
- **Missing Information:** Detailed financials of Vidya Wires, industry trends, and comparable IPO performances.
- An investment recommendation would typically consider the company's financial health, industry outlook, GMP trends, and risk factors.

### 6. Key Takeaways
- **Insufficient Data:** Due to the lack of specific GMP data and other critical information, a comprehensive analysis cannot be provided.
- **Action Items:** Potential investors should await the release of the IPO prospectus and GMP data to make informed decisions.
- **General Advice:** Always consider the company's fundamentals, industry trends, and market conditions before investing in an IPO.

In conclusion, without specific GMP data and other essential information, it's challenging to provide a detailed analysis or investment recommendation for Vidya Wires. Investors should consult reliable financial sources and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.

Any dispute with such supplier\nmay lead to interruption in our supplies of raw materials.\ne) While our revenues are growing pan-India across 20 states/union territories, however, our revenue is\nconcentrated in western India.

Any slowdown in these sectors may impact\nour business.\ng) Since our incorporation in the year 1981, we have expanded our business, scale of operations and delivered\nvariety of products, creating our position in the winding and conductivity products.

We may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers or may be unsuccessful in\nmanaging the effects of raw material price fluctuations. While in the past no such event has occurred, we cannot\nassure you that such event will not occur in future. In case, such event occurs it may impact business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. For further details, see\nsection titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Cost\nand availability of raw materials” on page 304.\nThe prices and supply of these primary raw materials are also affected by, among others, general economic\nconditions, competition, production costs and levels, transportation costs, indirect taxes and import duties, tariffs\nand currency exchange rate. Further, as we source our raw materials from third parties, our supply chain may be\ninterrupted by circumstances beyond our control. Poor quality roads and other transportation-related infrastructure\nproblems, inclement weather and road accidents may disrupt the transportation of raw materials.\nWhile we usually maintain sufficient inventory for all our primary raw materials. While we have not faced any\ninstances of shortage of raw materials during six months ended September 30, 2024 and Fiscals 2024, 2023 and\n2022, we cannot assure you that we will not face such instances in the future. In case we face shortage of raw\nmaterials, we may not be able to manufacture our products according to our pre-determined time frames, at our\npreviously estimated product costs, or at all, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash\nflows and reputation.\n11. While we export our products to over 20 countries across 5 continents, our inability to handle risks associated\nwith our export sales could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries.\nDuring six months ended September 30, 2024 and Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, we exported our products to over\n20 countries across 5 continents including United States of America, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Australia, Canada,\nEgypt, Singapore, etc. Details of revenue from export during six months period ended September 30, 2024 and\nFiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n(₹ in million)\n36\nParticulars For the six month Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nperiod ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmount Amount % of Amount % of Amount % of Amount % of\nrevenue revenue revenue revenue\nfrom from from from\noperation operation operation operation\nExports 757.44 10.04 1,617.89 13.64 1,867.17 18.46 1,343.14 14.72\nParticulars For the six month Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nperiod ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmount % of Amount % of Amount % of Amount % of\nrevenue revenue revenue revenue\nfrom from from from\noperation operation operation operation\nExports 757.44 10.04 1,617.89 13.64 1,867.17 18.46 1,343.14 14.72\nOur exports are subject to risks that are specific to each country and region in which we export goods, as well as\nrisks associated with exports in general. Our exports are subject to, among other risks and uncertainties, the\nfollowing demand of our products, local economic and political conditions, compliance with foreign laws and\nexchanges rates.\nIn addition, we may not perform as expected in international markets, because our competitors and the established\nplayers in these markets may have a more established presence and have more experience in operating in such\nmarket, which could allow them to have better relationships with distributors and consumers, gain early access\nto information regarding attractive sales opportunities and, in general, be better placed to launch products with\nother advantages of being a first mover.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,\ncash flows and prospects.\n12. We are subject to pre-qualification and pre order audit by some of our customers. In case our operating\nfacilities do not meet the customers’ requirements, we may not get orders from our customers.\nWe are subject to inspection and audit by our customers. The customers assess our operating facilities, as per their\nparameters. Typically, as a part of the process, customers officials visit our plant to conduct an on-site evaluation\nand verify the operating processes to assess whether it meets their standards. Further, we require UL approval for\nour supplies to United States of America. In case, we are not able to retain or renew this approval, it may adversely\naffect our business and results of operations. Additionally, the customers also assess other critical factors relevant\nto their requirements. Based on the inspection/audit findings, the orders are placed by the customers. Meeting the\nrequirements of the customers during such inspection and audit are essential for our operations. The pre-\nqualification process may involve additional cost for us. There have been instances where post audit/inspection\nthe customers have not placed order with us. In case, customers do not place order with us, it will impact our\noperations and financials.\n13. While we manufacture a majority portion of our products for sale based on confirmed orders under direct\narrangements, however, if there are any fluctuations in the demand for our products, it could affect our\ninventory levels, operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWhile we manufacture a majority portion of our products for sale based on confirmed orders under direct\narrangements, however, if there is any fluctuations in the demand for our products, it could affect our inventory\nlevels, operations, financial condition and cash flow. Our future earnings through the sale of our products may not\nbe realized as forecasted, due to cancellations or modifications of firm orders or our failure to accurately prepare\ndemand forecasts. If we are unable to appropriately estimate the demand for our products for any reason, it could\nresult in excess inventory levels or the unavailability of our products during increased demand, resulting in loss in\npotential sales. Our ability to accurately forecast customer demand for our products is affected by various factors,\nincluding:\n• a substantial increase or decrease in the demand for our products or for similar offerings of our competitors;\n• changes in customer requirements;\n• aggressive pricing strategies employed by our competitors;\n• failure to accurately forecast or changes in customer acceptance of our products;\n• limited historical demand and sales data for our products in newer markets;\n• fluctuations in foreign currencies; and\n• weakening of general economic conditions or customer confidence that could reduce the sale of our\nproducts.\n37\nParticulars Six months period ended Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNo. of Paid Delaye No. of Delaye Delaye No. of Paid Delaye No. of Paid Delaye\nemploy (Amou d employ d d employ (Amou d employ (Amou d\nees nt) Amoun ees Amoun Amoun ees nt) Amoun ees nt) Amoun\nt t t) t t\nProvident\nFund 79 1.27 - 61 1.64 - 49 2.68 - 48 2.39 0.01\nTDS on\nsalaries 79 0.14 0.24 61 0.25 0.11 49 0.24 - 48 0.25 -\nProfession\nTax 79 4.41 - 61 4.95 0.04 49 5.02 0.02 48 3.95 0.04\nInventory levels that exceed customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs or we may be\nrequired to sell our excess inventory at discounted prices, which will adversely affect our results of operations. On\nthe other hand, if we face demand in excess of our production, we may not be able to adequately respond to the\ndemand for our products. This could result in delays in delivery of our products to our customers and we may suffer\ndamage to our reputation and customer relationships. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our\ninventories at optimum levels to successfully respond to customer demand. While we have not faced any situation\nin six months period ended September 30, 2024 and Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022, we cannot assure you that such\ninstance will not occur in future.\n14. We operate in a manpower intensive industry and are subject to labour laws and any strike, work stoppage or\nincreased wage demand by our employees or any other kind of disputes with our employees or high attrition\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating processes are labour intensive in nature. As on December 31, 2024, we employ 133 permanent\nemployees and 385 contractual employees. If we or our contractors are unable to negotiate with the labour or their\nsub-contractors, it could result in work stoppages or increased operating costs due to higher than anticipated wages\nor benefits.\nOur success is substantially dependent on our ability to recruit, train and retain skilled manpower. Our attrition\nrate of employees for six months period September 24, 2024 and Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 was\n19.84%, 13.76%, 12.67%, and 11.06%, respectively. High attrition rates lead to an increase in our training and\nrecruitment costs, which may have an adverse impact on our profitability and financial condition. High attrition\nand competition for manpower may limit our ability to attract and retain the skilled manpower necessary for us to\nmeet our future growth requirements. There can be no assurance that skilled manpower will continue to be\navailable in sufficient numbers and at wages suitable to our requirements.\nWe are also subject to a number of labour laws that protect the interests of workers, including legislation that sets\nforth detailed procedures for dispute resolution and employee removal and legislation that imposes financial\nobligations on employers upon retrenchment. If labour laws become more stringent, it may become more difficult\nfor us to maintain flexible human resource policies, discharge employees or downsize, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. While\nthere has been no such event in the past, we cannot assure you that such event will not occur in future.\n15. There have been certain delay in payment of our statutory dues. Any delay in timely payment of statutory dues\nmay expose us to penalties from the regulators.\nOur Company is required to comply with various laws including law in respect of provident fund, professional\ntax, income tax act, etc. and is required to pay various statutory dues. Details of employees covered under such\nlegislations are as provided in below table.

Our registered office and operating facilities are situated on the leased land, any termination of lease may\n38\nimpact our operations.\nOur registered office and operating facilities are situated on lands leased from GIDC. In case of any termination\nof the lease, we may have to relocate our registered office and operating facilities. For further details of our\nproperties, please see section titled “Our Business -Properties” on page 205. Further, there can be no assurance\nthat we will not face any disruption of our rights as a lessee and that such lease agreements will not be terminated\nprematurely by the lessor. While no such disruptions have Any early termination or any disruption of our rights\nas lessee will adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\n17. We work with hazardous materials and activities in our operation can be dangerous, which could cause injuries\nto people or property.\nOur business requires individuals to work with hazardous materials, under potentially dangerous circumstances\n(such as being exposed to heated materials or with flammable materials. If improperly handled, heated metal can\nhurt our employees or other persons, and cause damage to our properties and the properties of others. Despite\ncompliance with requisite safety requirements and standards, our operations are subject to significant hazards,\nincluding explosions, fires, mechanical failures and other operational problems, inclement weather and natural\ndisasters and other environmental risks. While we have not experienced any such significant hazards in the past\nwhich caused any personal injury or destruction to property. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life\nor destruction of property and equipment as well as environmental damage, loss or shutting down of our facilities\ncould disrupt our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and\nreputation. We could also face claims and litigation filed on behalf of persons alleging injury predominantly due to\noccupational exposure to hazards at our facilities. If these claims and lawsuits, individually or in aggregate, are\nresolved against us, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely\naffected.\n18. A downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and\nour ability to raise capital in the future.\nThe credit ratings assigned to us and our borrowing facilities could change based upon, among other things, our\nresults of operations and financial condition. As of date of this DRHP our ratings are ‘CRISIL A-/Stable (long\nTerm rating), CRISIL A2+ (short term rating). These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating\nagencies, and we cannot assure you that any rating will not be downgraded or withdrawn by a rating agency in\nthe future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations to\nbuy, sell or hold the equity securities. If any credit rating agencies lowers our credit ratings or places us in “watch\nlist” for a possible downgrading or lowering or otherwise indicates that its outlook for that rating is negative, it\ncould have a material adverse effect on our costs and availability of capital, which could in turn have an adverse\neffect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to raise capital in the future.\n19. We are subject to quality requirements and any product defect issues or failure by us or our raw material\nsuppliers to comply with quality standards may lead to the cancellation of existing and future orders, recalls or\nwarranty and exposure to potential product liability claims.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product defects and subsequent liability claims if the use of any\nof our products results in personal injury or property damage. We may not be able to meet regulatory quality\nstandards in India or abroad, or the quality standards imposed by our customers or concerned entity in respect of\nISO 14001:2015 and ISO 9001: 2015 certifications applicable to our manufacturing processes, which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If any of our\nproducts do not meet regulatory standards or are defective, we may be, inter alia, (i) responsible for damages\nrelating to any defective products, (ii) required to replace, recall or redesign such products or (iii) incur significant\ncosts to defend any such claims. There have been certain instances in the past where we were required to replace\ncertain products not meeting the requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that we will comply\nor can continue to comply with all quality requirement standards of our customers in the future.\nOur failure to achieve or maintain compliance with regulatory requirements or quality standards may disrupt our\nability to supply products sufficient to meet demand until compliance is achieved or, with a component supplier,\nuntil a new supplier has been identified and evaluated. There is no assurance that our products will always meet\nthe satisfaction of our customers’ quality standards. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could cause\nadverse consequences to be imposed on us, including warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, the refusal\nof regulatory authorities to grant approvals, delays, suspensions or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation,\n39\nseizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, all of which could harm our\nbusiness.\n20. While our Promoters collectively have over six decades of experience, we are dependent on them and our KMP\nfor our operations and performance. The loss of or our inability to attract or retain such persons could\nmaterially adversely affect our business performance.\nOur Promoters, Shyamsundar Rathi and Shailesh Rathi have more than four decades and two decades of\nexperience, respectively in the Winding and Conductivity Products industry. The involvement of our Promoters\nin our operations, including through strategy, direction and customer relationships have been integral to our\ndevelopment and business and the loss of any of our Promoters may have a material adverse effect on our business\nand prospects.\nOur business and the implementation of our strategy is dependent upon our promoters and KMP, who oversee our\nday-to-day operations, strategy and growth of our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to\nretain these personnel or find adequate replacements in a timely manner, or at all. We may not be able to hire and\ntrain replacement personnel immediately when qualified personnel terminate their employment with our\nCompany. We may also be required to increase our levels of employee compensation more rapidly than in the\npast to remain competitive in attracting employees that our business requires. If one or more members of our KMP\nand SMP are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, such persons would be difficult to replace\nin a timely and cost-effective manner, and our business, prospects and results of operations could be materially\nadversely affected.\nIn addition, our success in expanding our business will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract, retain and\nmotivate skilled personnel. While we have experienced technical, finance and commercial teams, we may not be\nable to continuously attract or retain such personnel, or retain them on acceptable terms, given the demand for\nsuch personnel. The loss of key personnel or our inability to replace key personnel may restrict our ability to grow,\nto execute our strategy, to raise the profile of our brand, to raise funding, to make strategic decisions and to manage\nthe overall running of our operations, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations, financial position and cash flows.\n21. The objects of the Fresh Issue and deployment of funds are based on management estimates and have not been\nappraised by any external independent agency. There is no assurance that our expansion and existing plans\nwill be successful.\nWe intend to use the Net Proceeds from the Offer for the purposes described in “Objects of the Offer” on page\n95. These expansion and existing plans will result in additional costs of investment towards purchase of machinery\nand equipment in fixed assets and new equipment as well as additional working capital requirements. In the event\nthat we fail to achieve a sufficient level of revenue or manage our costs efficiently, our future financial\nperformance may be materially and adversely affected. The objects of the Fresh Issue and deployment of funds\nhave not been appraised by any external agency or any bank or financial institution or any other independent\nagency and are based on management estimates. While a monitoring agency will be appointed for monitoring\nutilization of the Net Proceeds, the proposed utilization of Net Proceeds is based on our current business plan,\nmanagement estimates, prevailing market conditions and other commercial considerations, which are subject to\nchange and may not be within the control of our management. Based on the competitive nature of our industry,\nwe may have to revise our business plan and/ or management estimates from time to time and consequently our\nfunding requirements may also change. Our internal management estimates may exceed fair market value or the\nvalue that would have been determined by third party appraisals, which may require us to reschedule or reallocate\nour project and capital expenditure and may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations and cash flows.\nOur Company, subject to applicable laws, will have flexibility to deploy the Net Proceeds. Further, pending\nutilization of Net Proceeds towards the Objects of the Offer, our Company will have the flexibility to deploy the\nNet Proceeds and to deposit the Net Proceeds temporarily in deposits with one or more scheduled commercial\nbanks included in Second Schedule of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, as may be approved by our Board or IPO\nCommittee. Accordingly, prospective investors in the Offer will need to rely upon our management’s judgment\nwith respect to the use of Net Proceeds.\n22. We are yet to place orders for equipment proposed to be funded through this Offer. In the event of any delay\nin placing the orders, or in the event the vendors are not able to provide the equipment in a timely manner, or\n40\nat all, it may result in time and cost over-runs and our business, results of operations, financial condition and\ncash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe are yet to place orders for the entire portion of the total capital expenditure which we propose to fund from\nthe Net Proceeds. We have not entered into any definitive agreements to utilize the Net Proceeds for these objects\nof the Offer and have relied on the quotations received from third parties for estimation of the cost, the TEV report\nissued by Dun & Bradstreet Information Services (India) Private Limited on December 26, 2024. The completion\nof such projects is dependent on the performance of external agencies, which are responsible for inter alia civil\nwork, procurement and installation of machinery and supply and testing of equipment. If the performance of these\nagencies is inadequate, it may result in incremental cost and time overruns which could adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations. We may also be unable to identify suitable replacement external agencies in a\ntimely manner. In addition, the actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ from our\nestimates as a result of, among other things, unforeseen delays or cost overruns, unanticipated expenses, regulatory\nchanges, engineering design changes and technological changes.\nThe quotations received by us for such plant and machinery as of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus\nare valid for a certain period of time and may be subject to revisions and other commercial and technical factors.\nAdditionally, in the event of any delay in placement of orders, the proposed schedule, implementation and\ndeployment of the Net Proceeds may be extended or may vary accordingly. We cannot assure you that the actual\ncosts incurred in relation to any of the Objects will be similar to and not exceed the amounts indicated in any third\nparty quotations as on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. The terms of certain quotations, also specify\nthat the prices in such quotations are subject to variation during the validity period pursuant to policy changes and\nchanges in the price list/raw materials of the vendors. If there is any increase in the costs of equipment, additional\ncosts will need to be borne by our Company from its internal accruals. As a result, there can be no assurance that\nwe will be able to undertake such capital expenditure within the cost indicated by such quotations or that there\nwill not be cost escalations. Our inability to procure such machinery and equipment at acceptable prices or in a\ntimely manner, may result in an increase in capital expenditure, the proposed schedule implementation and\ndeployment of the Net Proceeds may be extended or may vary accordingly, thereby resulting in an adverse effect\non our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n23. Any variation in the utilization of the Net Proceeds shall be subject to certain compliance requirements,\nincluding prior approval of the shareholders of our Company.\nWe propose to utilize the Net Proceeds towards (i) funding capital expenditure requirements for setting up new\nproject in our subsidiary viz. ALCU and (ii) repayment/prepayment, in full or part, of all or certain outstanding\nborrowings availed by our Company. For further details, see section titled “Objects of the Offer” beginning on\npage 95. The planned use of the Net Proceeds is based on current conditions and is subject to changes in external\ncircumstances, costs, other financial conditions or business strategies. The deployment of the Net Proceeds is\nbased on our current business plan, management estimates, current circumstances of our business, quotations\nreceived from vendors and suppliers, prevailing market conditions and other commercial and technical factors,\nand has not been appraised by any bank, financial institution or other independent party. These estimates may be\ninaccurate, and we may require additional funds to implement the purposes of the Offer. Accordingly, at this stage,\nwe cannot determine with any certainty if we would require the Net Proceeds to meet any other expenditure or\nfund any exigencies arising out of the competitive environment, business conditions, economic conditions or other\nfactors beyond our control. Any delay in our schedule of implementation may cause us to incur additional costs.\nSuch time and cost overruns may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and\ncash flows. In accordance with the Companies Act, 2013, and the SEBI ICDR Regulations, we cannot undertake\nvariation in the utilization of the Net Proceeds as disclosed in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus without obtaining\nthe approval of the shareholders through a special resolution. In the event of any such circumstances that require\nus to vary the disclosed utilization of the Net Proceeds, we may not be able to obtain the approval of the\nshareholders in a timely manner, or at all. Any delay or inability in obtaining such approval of the shareholders\nmay adversely affect our business or operations. Further, in the event that there is such a change in the objects of\nthe Offer, our Promoters would be required to provide an exit opportunity to the dissenting shareholders as\nprovided for in the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the conditions and manner prescribed under Schedule\nXX of the SEBI ICDR Regulations and applicable law. Additionally, the requirement on Promoters to provide an\nexit opportunity to such dissenting shareholders of our Company may deter our Promoters or controlling\nshareholders from agreeing to the variation of the proposed utilization of the Net Proceeds, even if such variation\nis in the interest of our Company. Further, we cannot assure you that our Promoters will have adequate resources\nat their disposal at all times to enable them to provide an exit opportunity to dissenting shareholders. In light of\nthese factors, we may not be able to vary the objects of the Offer to use any unutilized proceeds of the Fresh Issue,\n41\nParticulars For the six months Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nperiod ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024\nNet cash (used\nin)/generated from\nOperating activities (455.12) 21.63 375.35 (158.72)\nNet cash (used\nin)/generated from\ninvesting activities (5.53) (36.79) (56.49) (80.79)\nif any, even if such variation is in the interest of our Company.

Our Company has negative cash flows from its operating activities and investing activities in the past years,\ndetails of which are given below. Sustained negative cash flow could impact on our growth and business.\nOur Company had negative cash flows from our operating activities and investing activities as per the Restated\nConsolidated and Standalone Financial Information and the same are summarized as under:\n(₹ in million)\nParticulars For the six months Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nperiod ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024\nNet cash (used (455.12) 21.63 375.35 (158.72)\nin)/generated from\nOperating activities\nNet cash (used (5.53) (36.79) (56.49) (80.79)\nin)/generated from\ninvesting activities\nWe may experience negative cash flows in the future as well. Negative cash flows over extended periods, or\nsignificant negative cash flows in the short term, could materially impact our ability to operate our business and\nimplement our growth plans. This situation may have an adverse effect on our cash flows, business, future\nfinancial performance and results of operations.\nFor more information, see “Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” on page 300.\n25. We may not be successful in implementing our strategies, which could materially adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and prospects.\nThe success of our business depends greatly on our ability to effectively manage our business and implement our\nstrategies. For details, see section titled “Our Business” on page 184. We will require significant capital\ninvestments and cash outlays, which is likely to have a material impact on our results of operations. Our ability to\nsuccessfully execute these expansion plans will depend on various factors, including, among others:\n• the availability, terms and costs of financing;\n• the grant of regulatory approvals; and\n• general economic conditions in such markets.\nTo achieve and maintain future growth, we need to, inter alia, effectively manage our expansion projects,\naccurately assess new markets, attract new customers, obtain sufficient financing for our expected capital\nexpenditures, control our input costs, effectively expand, train and manage our employees, maintain sufficient\noperational and financial controls and make additional capital investments to take advantage of anticipated market\nconditions. We may not be able to achieve growth in revenues and profits or maintain such rate of growth in the\nfuture. Moreover, if we experience extended periods of very rapid growth, we may not be able to manage our\ngrowth effectively with available resources. If we are unable to execute our strategies effectively, and in a timely\nand successful manner, our business, financial condition and profitability will be adversely affected.\n26. Our financing agreements contain covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business. If we are not\nin compliance with certain of these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers from the respective lenders,\nour lenders may accelerate the repayment schedules, and enforce their respective security interests, leading to\na material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our outstanding borrowings on a consolidated basis was ₹ 1,427.20 million. For further,\ninformation, please see section titled "Financial Indebtedness" on page 328. Some of our financing arrangements\ncontains restrictive covenants. We are required to obtain prior written consent from our lenders for, among other\n42\nmatters, changing our capital structure or composition of our management or Board of Directors, issuance of\nfurther Equity Shares, etc. If we are not in compliance with certain of these covenants and are unable to obtain\nwaivers from the respective lenders or if any events of default occur, our lenders may accelerate the repayment\nschedules or terminate our credit facilities. Subsequently, if we are unable to pay our debt, affected lenders could\nalso proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. Till date we have not defaulted\nin payment of any loan, however we cannot assure you that such default may not occur in future.\nIf our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources become insufficient to pay our debt obligations\nor our contractual obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to sell assets or attempt to\nrestructure or refinance our existing indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on\nthe condition of the capital markets, our financial condition at such time and the terms of our other outstanding\ndebt instruments. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with\nmore onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt\ninstruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments\nof interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our\ncreditworthiness or credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable\nterms.\n27.

All statements contained in\nthis Draft Red Herring Prospectus that are not statements of historical fact constitute “forward-looking\nstatements”. All statements regarding our expected financial condition and results of operations, business, plans\nand prospects are “forward-looking statements”. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by\nwords or phrases such as “aim”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “expect”, “estimate”, “intend”, “likely to”, “may”, “can”,\n“could”, “should”, “seek to”, “shall”, “objective”, “plan”, “project”, “will”, “will continue”, “will pursue” or other\nwords or phrases of similar import. Similarly, statements that describe our Company’s strategies, objectives, plans\nor goals are also forward-looking statements. However, these are not the exclusive means of identifying forward\nlooking statements. All forward-looking statements whether made by us or any third parties in this Draft Red\nHerring Prospectus are based on our current plans, estimates, presumptions and expectations and are subject to\nrisks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\ncontemplated by the relevant forward-looking statement, including but not limited to, regulatory changes\npertaining to the industry in which our Company has businesses and our ability to respond to them, our ability to\nsuccessfully implement our strategy, our growth and expansion, our exposure to market risks, general economic\nand political conditions which have an impact on our business activities or investments, the monetary and fiscal\npolicies of India, inflation, deflation, unanticipated turbulence in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity\nprices or other rates or prices, the performance of the financial markets in India and globally, changes in domestic\nlaws, regulations and taxes and changes in competition in its industry. Important factors that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from our Company’s expectations include, but are not limited to, the following:\na) We have been operating for over 4 decades, however, any disruption, breakdown or shutdown of our operating\nfacilities, in future, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nb) We are one of the largest manufacturers of winding and conductivity products for a range of critical industries\nand applications, our operations and performance are largely dependent on copper based products which\nconstituted over 90% of our revenues. Any adverse changes in the conditions affecting such products’ market\nor any slowdown in demand of the said products can adversely impact our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nc) While we have longstanding relations with several of our customers and suppliers, we do not have long term\nagreements for supply of products or raw material with most of them. Failure to successfully continue our\nsupplier/customer relationships could adversely affect us.\nd) We are dependent on our top 5 suppliers for most of our raw material supplies. Any dispute with such supplier\nmay lead to interruption in our supplies of raw materials.\ne) While our revenues are growing pan-India across 20 states/union territories, however, our revenue is\nconcentrated in western India. Any slowdown in these states may impact our business.\nf) While we supply to various end-user industries, a significant part of our revenues comes from supplies to\npower & transmission, general engineering and electrical sector. Any slowdown in these sectors may impact\nour business.\ng) Since our incorporation in the year 1981, we have expanded our business, scale of operations and delivered\nvariety of products, creating our position in the winding and conductivity products. However, we face\ncompetitive pressures in our business in the future and our inability to compete effectively would be\ndetrimental to our business and prospects for future growth.\nFor further discussion of factors that could cause the actual results to differ from the expectations, please see the\nsections titled “Risk Factors”, “Our Business” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” on pages 30, 184 and 300, respectively. By their nature, certain market risk\ndisclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future.

There can be no assurance to investors that the expectations reflected in these\nforward-looking statements will prove to be correct.

For details, please see sections titled “Industry Overview” and “Our Business\n- Competition” on pages 124 and 203, respectively. The industry and markets for our products are characterized by\nfactors such as rapid technological change, the development of new end products and their rapid obsolescence,\nevolving industry standards and significant price erosion over the life of a product. We primarily compete based\non the following:\n(a) product functionality, quality and reliability;\n(b) design, technical, research and production capabilities;\n(c) ability to meet customers’ order requirements and delivery schedules; and\n(d) product price.\nThere can be no assurance that we will maintain our competitiveness in any of these areas with respect to any of\nour products.

Our exports are subject to, among other risks and uncertainties, the\nfollowing demand of our products, local economic and political conditions, compliance with foreign laws and\nexchanges rates.\nIn addition, we may not perform as expected in international markets, because our competitors and the established\nplayers in these markets may have a more established presence and have more experience in operating in such\nmarket, which could allow them to have better relationships with distributors and consumers, gain early access\nto information regarding attractive sales opportunities and, in general, be better placed to launch products with\nother advantages of being a first mover.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,\ncash flows and prospects.\n12. We are subject to pre-qualification and pre order audit by some of our customers. In case our operating\nfacilities do not meet the customers’ requirements, we may not get orders from our customers.\nWe are subject to inspection and audit by our customers. The customers assess our operating facilities, as per their\nparameters. Typically, as a part of the process, customers officials visit our plant to conduct an on-site evaluation\nand verify the operating processes to assess whether it meets their standards. Further, we require UL approval for\nour supplies to United States of America. In case, we are not able to retain or renew this approval, it may adversely\naffect our business and results of operations. Additionally, the customers also assess other critical factors relevant\nto their requirements. Based on the inspection/audit findings, the orders are placed by the customers. Meeting the\nrequirements of the customers during such inspection and audit are essential for our operations. The pre-\nqualification process may involve additional cost for us. There have been instances where post audit/inspection\nthe customers have not placed order with us. In case, customers do not place order with us, it will impact our\noperations and financials.\n13. While we manufacture a majority portion of our products for sale based on confirmed orders under direct\narrangements, however, if there are any fluctuations in the demand for our products, it could affect our\ninventory levels, operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWhile we manufacture a majority portion of our products for sale based on confirmed orders under direct\narrangements, however, if there is any fluctuations in the demand for our products, it could affect our inventory\nlevels, operations, financial condition and cash flow. Our future earnings through the sale of our products may not\nbe realized as forecasted, due to cancellations or modifications of firm orders or our failure to accurately prepare\ndemand forecasts. If we are unable to appropriately estimate the demand for our products for any reason, it could\nresult in excess inventory levels or the unavailability of our products during increased demand, resulting in loss in\npotential sales. Our ability to accurately forecast customer demand for our products is affected by various factors,\nincluding:\n• a substantial increase or decrease in the demand for our products or for similar offerings of our competitors;\n• changes in customer requirements;\n• aggressive pricing strategies employed by our competitors;\n• failure to accurately forecast or changes in customer acceptance of our products;\n• limited historical demand and sales data for our products in newer markets;\n• fluctuations in foreign currencies; and\n• weakening of general economic conditions or customer confidence that could reduce the sale of our\nproducts.\n37\nParticulars Six months period ended Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNo. of Paid Delaye No. of Delaye Delaye No. of Paid Delaye No. of Paid Delaye\nemploy (Amou d employ d d employ (Amou d employ (Amou d\nees nt) Amoun ees Amoun Amoun ees nt) Amoun ees nt) Amoun\nt t t) t t\nProvident\nFund 79 1.27 - 61 1.64 - 49 2.68 - 48 2.39 0.01\nTDS on\nsalaries 79 0.14 0.24 61 0.25 0.11 49 0.24 - 48 0.25 -\nProfession\nTax 79 4.41 - 61 4.95 0.04 49 5.02 0.02 48 3.95 0.04\nInventory levels that exceed customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs or we may be\nrequired to sell our excess inventory at discounted prices, which will adversely affect our results of operations.

We operate in a manpower intensive industry and are subject to labour laws and any strike, work stoppage or\nincreased wage demand by our employees or any other kind of disputes with our employees or high attrition\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating processes are labour intensive in nature. As on December 31, 2024, we employ 133 permanent\nemployees and 385 contractual employees. If we or our contractors are unable to negotiate with the labour or their\nsub-contractors, it could result in work stoppages or increased operating costs due to higher than anticipated wages\nor benefits.\nOur success is substantially dependent on our ability to recruit, train and retain skilled manpower. Our attrition\nrate of employees for six months period September 24, 2024 and Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 was\n19.84%, 13.76%, 12.67%, and 11.06%, respectively. High attrition rates lead to an increase in our training and\nrecruitment costs, which may have an adverse impact on our profitability and financial condition. High attrition\nand competition for manpower may limit our ability to attract and retain the skilled manpower necessary for us to\nmeet our future growth requirements. There can be no assurance that skilled manpower will continue to be\navailable in sufficient numbers and at wages suitable to our requirements.\nWe are also subject to a number of labour laws that protect the interests of workers, including legislation that sets\nforth detailed procedures for dispute resolution and employee removal and legislation that imposes financial\nobligations on employers upon retrenchment. If labour laws become more stringent, it may become more difficult\nfor us to maintain flexible human resource policies, discharge employees or downsize, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. While\nthere has been no such event in the past, we cannot assure you that such event will not occur in future.\n15. There have been certain delay in payment of our statutory dues. Any delay in timely payment of statutory dues\nmay expose us to penalties from the regulators.\nOur Company is required to comply with various laws including law in respect of provident fund, professional\ntax, income tax act, etc. and is required to pay various statutory dues. Details of employees covered under such\nlegislations are as provided in below table. In the past, there have been instances of delays in the remittance\ntowards the payment of these statutory dues including employee provident fund contributions on account of human\nerrors. The details of employees covered and defaults there in are reproduced in below table for the period\nspecified therein:\n(Amounts are in ₹ million)\nParticulars Six months period ended Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNo. of Paid Delaye No. of Delaye Delaye No. of Paid Delaye No. of Paid Delaye\nemploy (Amou d employ d d employ (Amou d employ (Amou d\nees nt) Amoun ees Amoun Amoun ees nt) Amoun ees nt) Amoun\nt t t) t t\nProvident 79 1.27 - 61 1.64 - 49 2.68 - 48 2.39 0.01\nFund\nTDS on 79 0.14 0.24 61 0.25 0.11 49 0.24 - 48 0.25 -\nsalaries\nProfession 79 4.41 - 61 4.95 0.04 49 5.02 0.02 48 3.95 0.04\nTax\nWhile we have addressed these issues, we cannot guarantee that similar delays or delays in payment of other\nstatutory dues will not occur in the future. Such delays could result in penalties, interest charges, or other legal\nactions by the relevant authorities, which could adversely impact our financial performance and reputation.\n16. Our registered office and operating facilities are situated on the leased land, any termination of lease may\n38\nimpact our operations.\nOur registered office and operating facilities are situated on lands leased from GIDC. In case of any termination\nof the lease, we may have to relocate our registered office and operating facilities. For further details of our\nproperties, please see section titled “Our Business -Properties” on page 205. Further, there can be no assurance\nthat we will not face any disruption of our rights as a lessee and that such lease agreements will not be terminated\nprematurely by the lessor. While no such disruptions have Any early termination or any disruption of our rights\nas lessee will adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\n17. We work with hazardous materials and activities in our operation can be dangerous, which could cause injuries\nto people or property.\nOur business requires individuals to work with hazardous materials, under potentially dangerous circumstances\n(such as being exposed to heated materials or with flammable materials. If improperly handled, heated metal can\nhurt our employees or other persons, and cause damage to our properties and the properties of others. Despite\ncompliance with requisite safety requirements and standards, our operations are subject to significant hazards,\nincluding explosions, fires, mechanical failures and other operational problems, inclement weather and natural\ndisasters and other environmental risks. While we have not experienced any such significant hazards in the past\nwhich caused any personal injury or destruction to property. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life\nor destruction of property and equipment as well as environmental damage, loss or shutting down of our facilities\ncould disrupt our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and\nreputation. We could also face claims and litigation filed on behalf of persons alleging injury predominantly due to\noccupational exposure to hazards at our facilities. If these claims and lawsuits, individually or in aggregate, are\nresolved against us, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely\naffected.\n18. A downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and\nour ability to raise capital in the future.\nThe credit ratings assigned to us and our borrowing facilities could change based upon, among other things, our\nresults of operations and financial condition. As of date of this DRHP our ratings are ‘CRISIL A-/Stable (long\nTerm rating), CRISIL A2+ (short term rating). These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating\nagencies, and we cannot assure you that any rating will not be downgraded or withdrawn by a rating agency in\nthe future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations to\nbuy, sell or hold the equity securities. If any credit rating agencies lowers our credit ratings or places us in “watch\nlist” for a possible downgrading or lowering or otherwise indicates that its outlook for that rating is negative, it\ncould have a material adverse effect on our costs and availability of capital, which could in turn have an adverse\neffect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to raise capital in the future.\n19. We are subject to quality requirements and any product defect issues or failure by us or our raw material\nsuppliers to comply with quality standards may lead to the cancellation of existing and future orders, recalls or\nwarranty and exposure to potential product liability claims.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product defects and subsequent liability claims if the use of any\nof our products results in personal injury or property damage. We may not be able to meet regulatory quality\nstandards in India or abroad, or the quality standards imposed by our customers or concerned entity in respect of\nISO 14001:2015 and ISO 9001: 2015 certifications applicable to our manufacturing processes, which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If any of our\nproducts do not meet regulatory standards or are defective, we may be, inter alia, (i) responsible for damages\nrelating to any defective products, (ii) required to replace, recall or redesign such products or (iii) incur significant\ncosts to defend any such claims. There have been certain instances in the past where we were required to replace\ncertain products not meeting the requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that we will comply\nor can continue to comply with all quality requirement standards of our customers in the future.\nOur failure to achieve or maintain compliance with regulatory requirements or quality standards may disrupt our\nability to supply products sufficient to meet demand until compliance is achieved or, with a component supplier,\nuntil a new supplier has been identified and evaluated. There is no assurance that our products will always meet\nthe satisfaction of our customers’ quality standards. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could cause\nadverse consequences to be imposed on us, including warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, the refusal\nof regulatory authorities to grant approvals, delays, suspensions or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation,\n39\nseizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, all of which could harm our\nbusiness.\n20. While our Promoters collectively have over six decades of experience, we are dependent on them and our KMP\nfor our operations and performance. The loss of or our inability to attract or retain such persons could\nmaterially adversely affect our business performance.\nOur Promoters, Shyamsundar Rathi and Shailesh Rathi have more than four decades and two decades of\nexperience, respectively in the Winding and Conductivity Products industry. The involvement of our Promoters\nin our operations, including through strategy, direction and customer relationships have been integral to our\ndevelopment and business and the loss of any of our Promoters may have a material adverse effect on our business\nand prospects.\nOur business and the implementation of our strategy is dependent upon our promoters and KMP, who oversee our\nday-to-day operations, strategy and growth of our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to\nretain these personnel or find adequate replacements in a timely manner, or at all. We may not be able to hire and\ntrain replacement personnel immediately when qualified personnel terminate their employment with our\nCompany. We may also be required to increase our levels of employee compensation more rapidly than in the\npast to remain competitive in attracting employees that our business requires. If one or more members of our KMP\nand SMP are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, such persons would be difficult to replace\nin a timely and cost-effective manner, and our business, prospects and results of operations could be materially\nadversely affected.\nIn addition, our success in expanding our business will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract, retain and\nmotivate skilled personnel. While we have experienced technical, finance and commercial teams, we may not be\nable to continuously attract or retain such personnel, or retain them on acceptable terms, given the demand for\nsuch personnel. The loss of key personnel or our inability to replace key personnel may restrict our ability to grow,\nto execute our strategy, to raise the profile of our brand, to raise funding, to make strategic decisions and to manage\nthe overall running of our operations, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations, financial position and cash flows.\n21. The objects of the Fresh Issue and deployment of funds are based on management estimates and have not been\nappraised by any external independent agency. There is no assurance that our expansion and existing plans\nwill be successful.\nWe intend to use the Net Proceeds from the Offer for the purposes described in “Objects of the Offer” on page\n95. These expansion and existing plans will result in additional costs of investment towards purchase of machinery\nand equipment in fixed assets and new equipment as well as additional working capital requirements. In the event\nthat we fail to achieve a sufficient level of revenue or manage our costs efficiently, our future financial\nperformance may be materially and adversely affected. The objects of the Fresh Issue and deployment of funds\nhave not been appraised by any external agency or any bank or financial institution or any other independent\nagency and are based on management estimates. While a monitoring agency will be appointed for monitoring\nutilization of the Net Proceeds, the proposed utilization of Net Proceeds is based on our current business plan,\nmanagement estimates, prevailing market conditions and other commercial considerations, which are subject to\nchange and may not be within the control of our management. Based on the competitive nature of our industry,\nwe may have to revise our business plan and/ or management estimates from time to time and consequently our\nfunding requirements may also change. Our internal management estimates may exceed fair market value or the\nvalue that would have been determined by third party appraisals, which may require us to reschedule or reallocate\nour project and capital expenditure and may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations and cash flows.\nOur Company, subject to applicable laws, will have flexibility to deploy the Net Proceeds. Further, pending\nutilization of Net Proceeds towards the Objects of the Offer, our Company will have the flexibility to deploy the\nNet Proceeds and to deposit the Net Proceeds temporarily in deposits with one or more scheduled commercial\nbanks included in Second Schedule of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, as may be approved by our Board or IPO\nCommittee. Accordingly, prospective investors in the Offer will need to rely upon our management’s judgment\nwith respect to the use of Net Proceeds.\n22. We are yet to place orders for equipment proposed to be funded through this Offer. In the event of any delay\nin placing the orders, or in the event the vendors are not able to provide the equipment in a timely manner, or\n40\nat all, it may result in time and cost over-runs and our business, results of operations, financial condition and\ncash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe are yet to place orders for the entire portion of the total capital expenditure which we propose to fund from\nthe Net Proceeds. We have not entered into any definitive agreements to utilize the Net Proceeds for these objects\nof the Offer and have relied on the quotations received from third parties for estimation of the cost, the TEV report\nissued by Dun & Bradstreet Information Services (India) Private Limited on December 26, 2024. The completion\nof such projects is dependent on the performance of external agencies, which are responsible for inter alia civil\nwork, procurement and installation of machinery and supply and testing of equipment. If the performance of these\nagencies is inadequate, it may result in incremental cost and time overruns which could adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations. We may also be unable to identify suitable replacement external agencies in a\ntimely manner. In addition, the actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ from our\nestimates as a result of, among other things, unforeseen delays or cost overruns, unanticipated expenses, regulatory\nchanges, engineering design changes and technological changes.\nThe quotations received by us for such plant and machinery as of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus\nare valid for a certain period of time and may be subject to revisions and other commercial and technical factors.\nAdditionally, in the event of any delay in placement of orders, the proposed schedule, implementation and\ndeployment of the Net Proceeds may be extended or may vary accordingly. We cannot assure you that the actual\ncosts incurred in relation to any of the Objects will be similar to and not exceed the amounts indicated in any third\nparty quotations as on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. The terms of certain quotations, also specify\nthat the prices in such quotations are subject to variation during the validity period pursuant to policy changes and\nchanges in the price list/raw materials of the vendors. If there is any increase in the costs of equipment, additional\ncosts will need to be borne by our Company from its internal accruals. As a result, there can be no assurance that\nwe will be able to undertake such capital expenditure within the cost indicated by such quotations or that there\nwill not be cost escalations. Our inability to procure such machinery and equipment at acceptable prices or in a\ntimely manner, may result in an increase in capital expenditure, the proposed schedule implementation and\ndeployment of the Net Proceeds may be extended or may vary accordingly, thereby resulting in an adverse effect\non our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n23. Any variation in the utilization of the Net Proceeds shall be subject to certain compliance requirements,\nincluding prior approval of the shareholders of our Company.\nWe propose to utilize the Net Proceeds towards (i) funding capital expenditure requirements for setting up new\nproject in our subsidiary viz. ALCU and (ii) repayment/prepayment, in full or part, of all or certain outstanding\nborrowings availed by our Company. For further details, see section titled “Objects of the Offer” beginning on\npage 95. The planned use of the Net Proceeds is based on current conditions and is subject to changes in external\ncircumstances, costs, other financial conditions or business strategies. The deployment of the Net Proceeds is\nbased on our current business plan, management estimates, current circumstances of our business, quotations\nreceived from vendors and suppliers, prevailing market conditions and other commercial and technical factors,\nand has not been appraised by any bank, financial institution or other independent party. These estimates may be\ninaccurate, and we may require additional funds to implement the purposes of the Offer. Accordingly, at this stage,\nwe cannot determine with any certainty if we would require the Net Proceeds to meet any other expenditure or\nfund any exigencies arising out of the competitive environment, business conditions, economic conditions or other\nfactors beyond our control. Any delay in our schedule of implementation may cause us to incur additional costs.\nSuch time and cost overruns may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and\ncash flows. In accordance with the Companies Act, 2013, and the SEBI ICDR Regulations, we cannot undertake\nvariation in the utilization of the Net Proceeds as disclosed in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus without obtaining\nthe approval of the shareholders through a special resolution. In the event of any such circumstances that require\nus to vary the disclosed utilization of the Net Proceeds, we may not be able to obtain the approval of the\nshareholders in a timely manner, or at all. Any delay or inability in obtaining such approval of the shareholders\nmay adversely affect our business or operations. Further, in the event that there is such a change in the objects of\nthe Offer, our Promoters would be required to provide an exit opportunity to the dissenting shareholders as\nprovided for in the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the conditions and manner prescribed under Schedule\nXX of the SEBI ICDR Regulations and applicable law. Additionally, the requirement on Promoters to provide an\nexit opportunity to such dissenting shareholders of our Company may deter our Promoters or controlling\nshareholders from agreeing to the variation of the proposed utilization of the Net Proceeds, even if such variation\nis in the interest of our Company. Further, we cannot assure you that our Promoters will have adequate resources\nat their disposal at all times to enable them to provide an exit opportunity to dissenting shareholders. In light of\nthese factors, we may not be able to vary the objects of the Offer to use any unutilized proceeds of the Fresh Issue,\n41\nParticulars For the six months Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nperiod ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024\nNet cash (used\nin)/generated from\nOperating activities (455.12) 21.63 375.35 (158.72)\nNet cash (used\nin)/generated from\ninvesting activities (5.53) (36.79) (56.49) (80.79)\nif any, even if such variation is in the interest of our Company. This may restrict our ability to respond to any\nchange in our business or financial condition by re-deploying the unutilized portion of Net Proceeds, if any, which\nmay adversely affect our business, financial conditions, cash flows and results of operations.\n24. Our Company has negative cash flows from its operating activities and investing activities in the past years,\ndetails of which are given below. Sustained negative cash flow could impact on our growth and business.\nOur Company had negative cash flows from our operating activities and investing activities as per the Restated\nConsolidated and Standalone Financial Information and the same are summarized as under:\n(₹ in million)\nParticulars For the six months Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nperiod ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024\nNet cash (used (455.12) 21.63 375.35 (158.72)\nin)/generated from\nOperating activities\nNet cash (used (5.53) (36.79) (56.49) (80.79)\nin)/generated from\ninvesting activities\nWe may experience negative cash flows in the future as well. Negative cash flows over extended periods, or\nsignificant negative cash flows in the short term, could materially impact our ability to operate our business and\nimplement our growth plans. This situation may have an adverse effect on our cash flows, business, future\nfinancial performance and results of operations.\nFor more information, see “Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” on page 300.\n25. We may not be successful in implementing our strategies, which could materially adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and prospects.\nThe success of our business depends greatly on our ability to effectively manage our business and implement our\nstrategies. For details, see section titled “Our Business” on page 184. We will require significant capital\ninvestments and cash outlays, which is likely to have a material impact on our results of operations. Our ability to\nsuccessfully execute these expansion plans will depend on various factors, including, among others:\n• the availability, terms and costs of financing;\n• the grant of regulatory approvals; and\n• general economic conditions in such markets.\nTo achieve and maintain future growth, we need to, inter alia, effectively manage our expansion projects,\naccurately assess new markets, attract new customers, obtain sufficient financing for our expected capital\nexpenditures, control our input costs, effectively expand, train and manage our employees, maintain sufficient\noperational and financial controls and make additional capital investments to take advantage of anticipated market\nconditions. We may not be able to achieve growth in revenues and profits or maintain such rate of growth in the\nfuture. Moreover, if we experience extended periods of very rapid growth, we may not be able to manage our\ngrowth effectively with available resources. If we are unable to execute our strategies effectively, and in a timely\nand successful manner, our business, financial condition and profitability will be adversely affected.\n26. Our financing agreements contain covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business. If we are not\nin compliance with certain of these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers from the respective lenders,\nour lenders may accelerate the repayment schedules, and enforce their respective security interests, leading to\na material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our outstanding borrowings on a consolidated basis was ₹ 1,427.20 million. For further,\ninformation, please see section titled "Financial Indebtedness" on page 328. Some of our financing arrangements\ncontains restrictive covenants. We are required to obtain prior written consent from our lenders for, among other\n42\nmatters, changing our capital structure or composition of our management or Board of Directors, issuance of\nfurther Equity Shares, etc. If we are not in compliance with certain of these covenants and are unable to obtain\nwaivers from the respective lenders or if any events of default occur, our lenders may accelerate the repayment\nschedules or terminate our credit facilities. Subsequently, if we are unable to pay our debt, affected lenders could\nalso proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. Till date we have not defaulted\nin payment of any loan, however we cannot assure you that such default may not occur in future.\nIf our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources become insufficient to pay our debt obligations\nor our contractual obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to sell assets or attempt to\nrestructure or refinance our existing indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on\nthe condition of the capital markets, our financial condition at such time and the terms of our other outstanding\ndebt instruments. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with\nmore onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt\ninstruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments\nof interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our\ncreditworthiness or credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable\nterms.\n27. Certain sections of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus contain information from CareEdge Report, which has\nbeen commissioned and paid for by our Company and any reliance on such information for making an\ninvestment decision in the Offer is subject to inherent risks.\nCertain sections of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus include information based on, or derived from, the CareEdge\nReport or extracts of the CareEdge Report prepared by CARE Analytics and Advisory Private Limited., which is\nnot related to our Company, Directors or Promoters.

Please see section titled “Industry Overview” on page 124.\n28. Our failure to identify and understand evolving industry trends and preferences and to develop new products\nto meet our customers’ demands may materially adversely affect our business.\nChanges in clients preferences, regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render\ncertain of our products obsolete or less attractive. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory\nstandards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis is a significant\nfactor in our ability to remain competitive. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the\nnecessary technological knowledge that will allow us to develop our product portfolio in this manner. If we are\nunable to obtain such knowledge in a timely manner, or at all, we may be unable to effectively implement our\nstrategies, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Moreover, we cannot assure you\nthat we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive or\nthat certain of our products will not become obsolete. We are also subject to the risks generally associated with\nnew product introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development\nand failure of products to operate properly.

Any dispute with such supplier\nmay lead to interruption in our supplies of raw materials.\ne) While our revenues are growing pan-India across 20 states/union territories, however, our revenue is\nconcentrated in western India.

Any slowdown in these sectors may impact\nour business.\ng) Since our incorporation in the year 1981, we have expanded our business, scale of operations and delivered\nvariety of products, creating our position in the winding and conductivity products.

We may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers or may be unsuccessful in\nmanaging the effects of raw material price fluctuations. While in the past no such event has occurred, we cannot\nassure you that such event will not occur in future. In case, such event occurs it may impact business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. For further details, see\nsection titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Cost\nand availability of raw materials” on page 304.\nThe prices and supply of these primary raw materials are also affected by, among others, general economic\nconditions, competition, production costs and levels, transportation costs, indirect taxes and import duties, tariffs\nand currency exchange rate. Further, as we source our raw materials from third parties, our supply chain may be\ninterrupted by circumstances beyond our control. Poor quality roads and other transportation-related infrastructure\nproblems, inclement weather and road accidents may disrupt the transportation of raw materials.\nWhile we usually maintain sufficient inventory for all our primary raw materials. While we have not faced any\ninstances of shortage of raw materials during six months ended September 30, 2024 and Fiscals 2024, 2023 and\n2022, we cannot assure you that we will not face such instances in the future. In case we face shortage of raw\nmaterials, we may not be able to manufacture our products according to our pre-determined time frames, at our\npreviously estimated product costs, or at all, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash\nflows and reputation.\n11. While we export our products to over 20 countries across 5 continents, our inability to handle risks associated\nwith our export sales could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries.\nDuring six months ended September 30, 2024 and Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, we exported our products to over\n20 countries across 5 continents including United States of America, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Australia, Canada,\nEgypt, Singapore, etc. Details of revenue from export during six months period ended September 30, 2024 and\nFiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n(₹ in million)\n36\nParticulars For the six month Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nperiod ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmount Amount % of Amount % of Amount % of Amount % of\nrevenue revenue revenue revenue\nfrom from from from\noperation operation operation operation\nExports 757.44 10.04 1,617.89 13.64 1,867.17 18.46 1,343.14 14.72\nParticulars For the six month Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nperiod ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmount % of Amount % of Amount % of Amount % of\nrevenue revenue revenue revenue\nfrom from from from\noperation operation operation operation\nExports 757.44 10.04 1,617.89 13.64 1,867.17 18.46 1,343.14 14.72\nOur exports are subject to risks that are specific to each country and region in which we export goods, as well as\nrisks associated with exports in general. Our exports are subject to, among other risks and uncertainties, the\nfollowing demand of our products, local economic and political conditions, compliance with foreign laws and\nexchanges rates.\nIn addition, we may not perform as expected in international markets, because our competitors and the established\nplayers in these markets may have a more established presence and have more experience in operating in such\nmarket, which could allow them to have better relationships with distributors and consumers, gain early access\nto information regarding attractive sales opportunities and, in general, be better placed to launch products with\nother advantages of being a first mover.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,\ncash flows and prospects.\n12. We are subject to pre-qualification and pre order audit by some of our customers. In case our operating\nfacilities do not meet the customers’ requirements, we may not get orders from our customers.\nWe are subject to inspection and audit by our customers. The customers assess our operating facilities, as per their\nparameters. Typically, as a part of the process, customers officials visit our plant to conduct an on-site evaluation\nand verify the operating processes to assess whether it meets their standards. Further, we require UL approval for\nour supplies to United States of America. In case, we are not able to retain or renew this approval, it may adversely\naffect our business and results of operations. Additionally, the customers also assess other critical factors relevant\nto their requirements. Based on the inspection/audit findings, the orders are placed by the customers. Meeting the\nrequirements of the customers during such inspection and audit are essential for our operations. The pre-\nqualification process may involve additional cost for us. There have been instances where post audit/inspection\nthe customers have not placed order with us. In case, customers do not place order with us, it will impact our\noperations and financials.\n13. While we manufacture a majority portion of our products for sale based on confirmed orders under direct\narrangements, however, if there are any fluctuations in the demand for our products, it could affect our\ninventory levels, operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWhile we manufacture a majority portion of our products for sale based on confirmed orders under direct\narrangements, however, if there is any fluctuations in the demand for our products, it could affect our inventory\nlevels, operations, financial condition and cash flow. Our future earnings through the sale of our products may not\nbe realized as forecasted, due to cancellations or modifications of firm orders or our failure to accurately prepare\ndemand forecasts. If we are unable to appropriately estimate the demand for our products for any reason, it could\nresult in excess inventory levels or the unavailability of our products during increased demand, resulting in loss in\npotential sales. Our ability to accurately forecast customer demand for our products is affected by various factors,\nincluding:\n• a substantial increase or decrease in the demand for our products or for similar offerings of our competitors;\n• changes in customer requirements;\n• aggressive pricing strategies employed by our competitors;\n• failure to accurately forecast or changes in customer acceptance of our products;\n• limited historical demand and sales data for our products in newer markets;\n• fluctuations in foreign currencies; and\n• weakening of general economic conditions or customer confidence that could reduce the sale of our\nproducts.\n37\nParticulars Six months period ended Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNo. of Paid Delaye No. of Delaye Delaye No. of Paid Delaye No. of Paid Delaye\nemploy (Amou d employ d d employ (Amou d employ (Amou d\nees nt) Amoun ees Amoun Amoun ees nt) Amoun ees nt) Amoun\nt t t) t t\nProvident\nFund 79 1.27 - 61 1.64 - 49 2.68 - 48 2.39 0.01\nTDS on\nsalaries 79 0.14 0.24 61 0.25 0.11 49 0.24 - 48 0.25 -\nProfession\nTax 79 4.41 - 61 4.95 0.04 49 5.02 0.02 48 3.95 0.04\nInventory levels that exceed customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs or we may be\nrequired to sell our excess inventory at discounted prices, which will adversely affect our results of operations. On\nthe other hand, if we face demand in excess of our production, we may not be able to adequately respond to the\ndemand for our products. This could result in delays in delivery of our products to our customers and we may suffer\ndamage to our reputation and customer relationships. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our\ninventories at optimum levels to successfully respond to customer demand. While we have not faced any situation\nin six months period ended September 30, 2024 and Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022, we cannot assure you that such\ninstance will not occur in future.\n14. We operate in a manpower intensive industry and are subject to labour laws and any strike, work stoppage or\nincreased wage demand by our employees or any other kind of disputes with our employees or high attrition\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating processes are labour intensive in nature. As on December 31, 2024, we employ 133 permanent\nemployees and 385 contractual employees. If we or our contractors are unable to negotiate with the labour or their\nsub-contractors, it could result in work stoppages or increased operating costs due to higher than anticipated wages\nor benefits.\nOur success is substantially dependent on our ability to recruit, train and retain skilled manpower. Our attrition\nrate of employees for six months period September 24, 2024 and Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 was\n19.84%, 13.76%, 12.67%, and 11.06%, respectively. High attrition rates lead to an increase in our training and\nrecruitment costs, which may have an adverse impact on our profitability and financial condition. High attrition\nand competition for manpower may limit our ability to attract and retain the skilled manpower necessary for us to\nmeet our future growth requirements. There can be no assurance that skilled manpower will continue to be\navailable in sufficient numbers and at wages suitable to our requirements.\nWe are also subject to a number of labour laws that protect the interests of workers, including legislation that sets\nforth detailed procedures for dispute resolution and employee removal and legislation that imposes financial\nobligations on employers upon retrenchment. If labour laws become more stringent, it may become more difficult\nfor us to maintain flexible human resource policies, discharge employees or downsize, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. While\nthere has been no such event in the past, we cannot assure you that such event will not occur in future.\n15. There have been certain delay in payment of our statutory dues. Any delay in timely payment of statutory dues\nmay expose us to penalties from the regulators.\nOur Company is required to comply with various laws including law in respect of provident fund, professional\ntax, income tax act, etc. and is required to pay various statutory dues. Details of employees covered under such\nlegislations are as provided in below table.

Our registered office and operating facilities are situated on the leased land, any termination of lease may\n38\nimpact our operations.\nOur registered office and operating facilities are situated on lands leased from GIDC. In case of any termination\nof the lease, we may have to relocate our registered office and operating facilities. For further details of our\nproperties, please see section titled “Our Business -Properties” on page 205. Further, there can be no assurance\nthat we will not face any disruption of our rights as a lessee and that such lease agreements will not be terminated\nprematurely by the lessor. While no such disruptions have Any early termination or any disruption of our rights\nas lessee will adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\n17. We work with hazardous materials and activities in our operation can be dangerous, which could cause injuries\nto people or property.\nOur business requires individuals to work with hazardous materials, under potentially dangerous circumstances\n(such as being exposed to heated materials or with flammable materials. If improperly handled, heated metal can\nhurt our employees or other persons, and cause damage to our properties and the properties of others. Despite\ncompliance with requisite safety requirements and standards, our operations are subject to significant hazards,\nincluding explosions, fires, mechanical failures and other operational problems, inclement weather and natural\ndisasters and other environmental risks. While we have not experienced any such significant hazards in the past\nwhich caused any personal injury or destruction to property. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life\nor destruction of property and equipment as well as environmental damage, loss or shutting down of our facilities\ncould disrupt our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and\nreputation. We could also face claims and litigation filed on behalf of persons alleging injury predominantly due to\noccupational exposure to hazards at our facilities. If these claims and lawsuits, individually or in aggregate, are\nresolved against us, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely\naffected.\n18. A downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and\nour ability to raise capital in the future.\nThe credit ratings assigned to us and our borrowing facilities could change based upon, among other things, our\nresults of operations and financial condition. As of date of this DRHP our ratings are ‘CRISIL A-/Stable (long\nTerm rating), CRISIL A2+ (short term rating). These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating\nagencies, and we cannot assure you that any rating will not be downgraded or withdrawn by a rating agency in\nthe future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations to\nbuy, sell or hold the equity securities. If any credit rating agencies lowers our credit ratings or places us in “watch\nlist” for a possible downgrading or lowering or otherwise indicates that its outlook for that rating is negative, it\ncould have a material adverse effect on our costs and availability of capital, which could in turn have an adverse\neffect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to raise capital in the future.\n19. We are subject to quality requirements and any product defect issues or failure by us or our raw material\nsuppliers to comply with quality standards may lead to the cancellation of existing and future orders, recalls or\nwarranty and exposure to potential product liability claims.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product defects and subsequent liability claims if the use of any\nof our products results in personal injury or property damage. We may not be able to meet regulatory quality\nstandards in India or abroad, or the quality standards imposed by our customers or concerned entity in respect of\nISO 14001:2015 and ISO 9001: 2015 certifications applicable to our manufacturing processes, which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If any of our\nproducts do not meet regulatory standards or are defective, we may be, inter alia, (i) responsible for damages\nrelating to any defective products, (ii) required to replace, recall or redesign such products or (iii) incur significant\ncosts to defend any such claims. There have been certain instances in the past where we were required to replace\ncertain products not meeting the requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that we will comply\nor can continue to comply with all quality requirement standards of our customers in the future.\nOur failure to achieve or maintain compliance with regulatory requirements or quality standards may disrupt our\nability to supply products sufficient to meet demand until compliance is achieved or, with a component supplier,\nuntil a new supplier has been identified and evaluated. There is no assurance that our products will always meet\nthe satisfaction of our customers’ quality standards. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could cause\nadverse consequences to be imposed on us, including warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, the refusal\nof regulatory authorities to grant approvals, delays, suspensions or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation,\n39\nseizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, all of which could harm our\nbusiness.\n20. While our Promoters collectively have over six decades of experience, we are dependent on them and our KMP\nfor our operations and performance. The loss of or our inability to attract or retain such persons could\nmaterially adversely affect our business performance.\nOur Promoters, Shyamsundar Rathi and Shailesh Rathi have more than four decades and two decades of\nexperience, respectively in the Winding and Conductivity Products industry. The involvement of our Promoters\nin our operations, including through strategy, direction and customer relationships have been integral to our\ndevelopment and business and the loss of any of our Promoters may have a material adverse effect on our business\nand prospects.\nOur business and the implementation of our strategy is dependent upon our promoters and KMP, who oversee our\nday-to-day operations, strategy and growth of our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to\nretain these personnel or find adequate replacements in a timely manner, or at all. We may not be able to hire and\ntrain replacement personnel immediately when qualified personnel terminate their employment with our\nCompany. We may also be required to increase our levels of employee compensation more rapidly than in the\npast to remain competitive in attracting employees that our business requires. If one or more members of our KMP\nand SMP are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, such persons would be difficult to replace\nin a timely and cost-effective manner, and our business, prospects and results of operations could be materially\nadversely affected.\nIn addition, our success in expanding our business will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract, retain and\nmotivate skilled personnel. While we have experienced technical, finance and commercial teams, we may not be\nable to continuously attract or retain such personnel, or retain them on acceptable terms, given the demand for\nsuch personnel. The loss of key personnel or our inability to replace key personnel may restrict our ability to grow,\nto execute our strategy, to raise the profile of our brand, to raise funding, to make strategic decisions and to manage\nthe overall running of our operations, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations, financial position and cash flows.\n21. The objects of the Fresh Issue and deployment of funds are based on management estimates and have not been\nappraised by any external independent agency. There is no assurance that our expansion and existing plans\nwill be successful.\nWe intend to use the Net Proceeds from the Offer for the purposes described in “Objects of the Offer” on page\n95. These expansion and existing plans will result in additional costs of investment towards purchase of machinery\nand equipment in fixed assets and new equipment as well as additional working capital requirements. In the event\nthat we fail to achieve a sufficient level of revenue or manage our costs efficiently, our future financial\nperformance may be materially and adversely affected. The objects of the Fresh Issue and deployment of funds\nhave not been appraised by any external agency or any bank or financial institution or any other independent\nagency and are based on management estimates. While a monitoring agency will be appointed for monitoring\nutilization of the Net Proceeds, the proposed utilization of Net Proceeds is based on our current business plan,\nmanagement estimates, prevailing market conditions and other commercial considerations, which are subject to\nchange and may not be within the control of our management. Based on the competitive nature of our industry,\nwe may have to revise our business plan and/ or management estimates from time to time and consequently our\nfunding requirements may also change. Our internal management estimates may exceed fair market value or the\nvalue that would have been determined by third party appraisals, which may require us to reschedule or reallocate\nour project and capital expenditure and may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations and cash flows.\nOur Company, subject to applicable laws, will have flexibility to deploy the Net Proceeds. Further, pending\nutilization of Net Proceeds towards the Objects of the Offer, our Company will have the flexibility to deploy the\nNet Proceeds and to deposit the Net Proceeds temporarily in deposits with one or more scheduled commercial\nbanks included in Second Schedule of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, as may be approved by our Board or IPO\nCommittee. Accordingly, prospective investors in the Offer will need to rely upon our management’s judgment\nwith respect to the use of Net Proceeds.\n22. We are yet to place orders for equipment proposed to be funded through this Offer. In the event of any delay\nin placing the orders, or in the event the vendors are not able to provide the equipment in a timely manner, or\n40\nat all, it may result in time and cost over-runs and our business, results of operations, financial condition and\ncash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe are yet to place orders for the entire portion of the total capital expenditure which we propose to fund from\nthe Net Proceeds. We have not entered into any definitive agreements to utilize the Net Proceeds for these objects\nof the Offer and have relied on the quotations received from third parties for estimation of the cost, the TEV report\nissued by Dun & Bradstreet Information Services (India) Private Limited on December 26, 2024. The completion\nof such projects is dependent on the performance of external agencies, which are responsible for inter alia civil\nwork, procurement and installation of machinery and supply and testing of equipment. If the performance of these\nagencies is inadequate, it may result in incremental cost and time overruns which could adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations. We may also be unable to identify suitable replacement external agencies in a\ntimely manner. In addition, the actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ from our\nestimates as a result of, among other things, unforeseen delays or cost overruns, unanticipated expenses, regulatory\nchanges, engineering design changes and technological changes.\nThe quotations received by us for such plant and machinery as of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus\nare valid for a certain period of time and may be subject to revisions and other commercial and technical factors.\nAdditionally, in the event of any delay in placement of orders, the proposed schedule, implementation and\ndeployment of the Net Proceeds may be extended or may vary accordingly. We cannot assure you that the actual\ncosts incurred in relation to any of the Objects will be similar to and not exceed the amounts indicated in any third\nparty quotations as on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. The terms of certain quotations, also specify\nthat the prices in such quotations are subject to variation during the validity period pursuant to policy changes and\nchanges in the price list/raw materials of the vendors. If there is any increase in the costs of equipment, additional\ncosts will need to be borne by our Company from its internal accruals. As a result, there can be no assurance that\nwe will be able to undertake such capital expenditure within the cost indicated by such quotations or that there\nwill not be cost escalations. Our inability to procure such machinery and equipment at acceptable prices or in a\ntimely manner, may result in an increase in capital expenditure, the proposed schedule implementation and\ndeployment of the Net Proceeds may be extended or may vary accordingly, thereby resulting in an adverse effect\non our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n23. Any variation in the utilization of the Net Proceeds shall be subject to certain compliance requirements,\nincluding prior approval of the shareholders of our Company.\nWe propose to utilize the Net Proceeds towards (i) funding capital expenditure requirements for setting up new\nproject in our subsidiary viz. ALCU and (ii) repayment/prepayment, in full or part, of all or certain outstanding\nborrowings availed by our Company. For further details, see section titled “Objects of the Offer” beginning on\npage 95. The planned use of the Net Proceeds is based on current conditions and is subject to changes in external\ncircumstances, costs, other financial conditions or business strategies. The deployment of the Net Proceeds is\nbased on our current business plan, management estimates, current circumstances of our business, quotations\nreceived from vendors and suppliers, prevailing market conditions and other commercial and technical factors,\nand has not been appraised by any bank, financial institution or other independent party. These estimates may be\ninaccurate, and we may require additional funds to implement the purposes of the Offer. Accordingly, at this stage,\nwe cannot determine with any certainty if we would require the Net Proceeds to meet any other expenditure or\nfund any exigencies arising out of the competitive environment, business conditions, economic conditions or other\nfactors beyond our control. Any delay in our schedule of implementation may cause us to incur additional costs.\nSuch time and cost overruns may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and\ncash flows. In accordance with the Companies Act, 2013, and the SEBI ICDR Regulations, we cannot undertake\nvariation in the utilization of the Net Proceeds as disclosed in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus without obtaining\nthe approval of the shareholders through a special resolution. In the event of any such circumstances that require\nus to vary the disclosed utilization of the Net Proceeds, we may not be able to obtain the approval of the\nshareholders in a timely manner, or at all. Any delay or inability in obtaining such approval of the shareholders\nmay adversely affect our business or operations. Further, in the event that there is such a change in the objects of\nthe Offer, our Promoters would be required to provide an exit opportunity to the dissenting shareholders as\nprovided for in the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the conditions and manner prescribed under Schedule\nXX of the SEBI ICDR Regulations and applicable law. Additionally, the requirement on Promoters to provide an\nexit opportunity to such dissenting shareholders of our Company may deter our Promoters or controlling\nshareholders from agreeing to the variation of the proposed utilization of the Net Proceeds, even if such variation\nis in the interest of our Company. Further, we cannot assure you that our Promoters will have adequate resources\nat their disposal at all times to enable them to provide an exit opportunity to dissenting shareholders. In light of\nthese factors, we may not be able to vary the objects of the Offer to use any unutilized proceeds of the Fresh Issue,\n41\nParticulars For the six months Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nperiod ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024\nNet cash (used\nin)/generated from\nOperating activities (455.12) 21.63 375.35 (158.72)\nNet cash (used\nin)/generated from\ninvesting activities (5.53) (36.79) (56.49) (80.79)\nif any, even if such variation is in the interest of our Company.

Our Company has negative cash flows from its operating activities and investing activities in the past years,\ndetails of which are given below.

Negative cash flows over extended periods, or\nsignificant negative cash flows in the short term, could materially impact our ability to operate our business and\nimplement our growth plans. This situation may have an adverse effect on our cash flows, business, future\nfinancial performance and results of operations.\nFor more information, see “Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” on page 300.\n25. We may not be successful in implementing our strategies, which could materially adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and prospects.\nThe success of our business depends greatly on our ability to effectively manage our business and implement our\nstrategies. For details, see section titled “Our Business” on page 184. We will require significant capital\ninvestments and cash outlays, which is likely to have a material impact on our results of operations. Our ability to\nsuccessfully execute these expansion plans will depend on various factors, including, among others:\n• the availability, terms and costs of financing;\n• the grant of regulatory approvals; and\n• general economic conditions in such markets.\nTo achieve and maintain future growth, we need to, inter alia, effectively manage our expansion projects,\naccurately assess new markets, attract new customers, obtain sufficient financing for our expected capital\nexpenditures, control our input costs, effectively expand, train and manage our employees, maintain sufficient\noperational and financial controls and make additional capital investments to take advantage of anticipated market\nconditions. We may not be able to achieve growth in revenues and profits or maintain such rate of growth in the\nfuture. Moreover, if we experience extended periods of very rapid growth, we may not be able to manage our\ngrowth effectively with available resources. If we are unable to execute our strategies effectively, and in a timely\nand successful manner, our business, financial condition and profitability will be adversely affected.\n26. Our financing agreements contain covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business. If we are not\nin compliance with certain of these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers from the respective lenders,\nour lenders may accelerate the repayment schedules, and enforce their respective security interests, leading to\na material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our outstanding borrowings on a consolidated basis was ₹ 1,427.20 million. For further,\ninformation, please see section titled "Financial Indebtedness" on page 328. Some of our financing arrangements\ncontains restrictive covenants. We are required to obtain prior written consent from our lenders for, among other\n42\nmatters, changing our capital structure or composition of our management or Board of Directors, issuance of\nfurther Equity Shares, etc. If we are not in compliance with certain of these covenants and are unable to obtain\nwaivers from the respective lenders or if any events of default occur, our lenders may accelerate the repayment\nschedules or terminate our credit facilities. Subsequently, if we are unable to pay our debt, affected lenders could\nalso proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. Till date we have not defaulted\nin payment of any loan, however we cannot assure you that such default may not occur in future.\nIf our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources become insufficient to pay our debt obligations\nor our contractual obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to sell assets or attempt to\nrestructure or refinance our existing indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on\nthe condition of the capital markets, our financial condition at such time and the terms of our other outstanding\ndebt instruments. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with\nmore onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt\ninstruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments\nof interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our\ncreditworthiness or credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable\nterms.\n27.

All statements contained in\nthis Draft Red Herring Prospectus that are not statements of historical fact constitute “forward-looking\nstatements”. All statements regarding our expected financial condition and results of operations, business, plans\nand prospects are “forward-looking statements”. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by\nwords or phrases such as “aim”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “expect”, “estimate”, “intend”, “likely to”, “may”, “can”,\n“could”, “should”, “seek to”, “shall”, “objective”, “plan”, “project”, “will”, “will continue”, “will pursue” or other\nwords or phrases of similar import. Similarly, statements that describe our Company’s strategies, objectives, plans\nor goals are also forward-looking statements. However, these are not the exclusive means of identifying forward\nlooking statements. All forward-looking statements whether made by us or any third parties in this Draft Red\nHerring Prospectus are based on our current plans, estimates, presumptions and expectations and are subject to\nrisks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\ncontemplated by the relevant forward-looking statement, including but not limited to, regulatory changes\npertaining to the industry in which our Company has businesses and our ability to respond to them, our ability to\nsuccessfully implement our strategy, our growth and expansion, our exposure to market risks, general economic\nand political conditions which have an impact on our business activities or investments, the monetary and fiscal\npolicies of India, inflation, deflation, unanticipated turbulence in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity\nprices or other rates or prices, the performance of the financial markets in India and globally, changes in domestic\nlaws, regulations and taxes and changes in competition in its industry. Important factors that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from our Company’s expectations include, but are not limited to, the following:\na) We have been operating for over 4 decades, however, any disruption, breakdown or shutdown of our operating\nfacilities, in future, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nb) We are one of the largest manufacturers of winding and conductivity products for a range of critical industries\nand applications, our operations and performance are largely dependent on copper based products which\nconstituted over 90% of our revenues. Any adverse changes in the conditions affecting such products’ market\nor any slowdown in demand of the said products can adversely impact our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nc) While we have longstanding relations with several of our customers and suppliers, we do not have long term\nagreements for supply of products or raw material with most of them. Failure to successfully continue our\nsupplier/customer relationships could adversely affect us.\nd) We are dependent on our top 5 suppliers for most of our raw material supplies. Any dispute with such supplier\nmay lead to interruption in our supplies of raw materials.\ne) While our revenues are growing pan-India across 20 states/union territories, however, our revenue is\nconcentrated in western India. Any slowdown in these states may impact our business.\nf) While we supply to various end-user industries, a significant part of our revenues comes from supplies to\npower & transmission, general engineering and electrical sector. Any slowdown in these sectors may impact\nour business.\ng) Since our incorporation in the year 1981, we have expanded our business, scale of operations and delivered\nvariety of products, creating our position in the winding and conductivity products. However, we face\ncompetitive pressures in our business in the future and our inability to compete effectively would be\ndetrimental to our business and prospects for future growth.\nFor further discussion of factors that could cause the actual results to differ from the expectations, please see the\nsections titled “Risk Factors”, “Our Business” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” on pages 30, 184 and 300, respectively. By their nature, certain market risk\ndisclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future.

There can be no assurance to investors that the expectations reflected in these\nforward-looking statements will prove to be correct.

For details, please see sections titled “Industry Overview” and “Our Business\n- Competition” on pages 124 and 203, respectively. The industry and markets for our products are characterized by\nfactors such as rapid technological change, the development of new end products and their rapid obsolescence,\nevolving industry standards and significant price erosion over the life of a product. We primarily compete based\non the following:\n(a) product functionality, quality and reliability;\n(b) design, technical, research and production capabilities;\n(c) ability to meet customers’ order requirements and delivery schedules; and\n(d) product price.\nThere can be no assurance that we will maintain our competitiveness in any of these areas with respect to any of\nour products.

Our exports are subject to, among other risks and uncertainties, the\nfollowing demand of our products, local economic and political conditions, compliance with foreign laws and\nexchanges rates.\nIn addition, we may not perform as expected in international markets, because our competitors and the established\nplayers in these markets may have a more established presence and have more experience in operating in such\nmarket, which could allow them to have better relationships with distributors and consumers, gain early access\nto information regarding attractive sales opportunities and, in general, be better placed to launch products with\nother advantages of being a first mover.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,\ncash flows and prospects.\n12. We are subject to pre-qualification and pre order audit by some of our customers. In case our operating\nfacilities do not meet the customers’ requirements, we may not get orders from our customers.\nWe are subject to inspection and audit by our customers. The customers assess our operating facilities, as per their\nparameters. Typically, as a part of the process, customers officials visit our plant to conduct an on-site evaluation\nand verify the operating processes to assess whether it meets their standards. Further, we require UL approval for\nour supplies to United States of America. In case, we are not able to retain or renew this approval, it may adversely\naffect our business and results of operations. Additionally, the customers also assess other critical factors relevant\nto their requirements. Based on the inspection/audit findings, the orders are placed by the customers. Meeting the\nrequirements of the customers during such inspection and audit are essential for our operations. The pre-\nqualification process may involve additional cost for us. There have been instances where post audit/inspection\nthe customers have not placed order with us. In case, customers do not place order with us, it will impact our\noperations and financials.\n13. While we manufacture a majority portion of our products for sale based on confirmed orders under direct\narrangements, however, if there are any fluctuations in the demand for our products, it could affect our\ninventory levels, operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWhile we manufacture a majority portion of our products for sale based on confirmed orders under direct\narrangements, however, if there is any fluctuations in the demand for our products, it could affect our inventory\nlevels, operations, financial condition and cash flow. Our future earnings through the sale of our products may not\nbe realized as forecasted, due to cancellations or modifications of firm orders or our failure to accurately prepare\ndemand forecasts. If we are unable to appropriately estimate the demand for our products for any reason, it could\nresult in excess inventory levels or the unavailability of our products during increased demand, resulting in loss in\npotential sales. Our ability to accurately forecast customer demand for our products is affected by various factors,\nincluding:\n• a substantial increase or decrease in the demand for our products or for similar offerings of our competitors;\n• changes in customer requirements;\n• aggressive pricing strategies employed by our competitors;\n• failure to accurately forecast or changes in customer acceptance of our products;\n• limited historical demand and sales data for our products in newer markets;\n• fluctuations in foreign currencies; and\n• weakening of general economic conditions or customer confidence that could reduce the sale of our\nproducts.\n37\nParticulars Six months period ended Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNo. of Paid Delaye No. of Delaye Delaye No. of Paid Delaye No. of Paid Delaye\nemploy (Amou d employ d d employ (Amou d employ (Amou d\nees nt) Amoun ees Amoun Amoun ees nt) Amoun ees nt) Amoun\nt t t) t t\nProvident\nFund 79 1.27 - 61 1.64 - 49 2.68 - 48 2.39 0.01\nTDS on\nsalaries 79 0.14 0.24 61 0.25 0.11 49 0.24 - 48 0.25 -\nProfession\nTax 79 4.41 - 61 4.95 0.04 49 5.02 0.02 48 3.95 0.04\nInventory levels that exceed customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs or we may be\nrequired to sell our excess inventory at discounted prices, which will adversely affect our results of operations.

We operate in a manpower intensive industry and are subject to labour laws and any strike, work stoppage or\nincreased wage demand by our employees or any other kind of disputes with our employees or high attrition\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating processes are labour intensive in nature. As on December 31, 2024, we employ 133 permanent\nemployees and 385 contractual employees. If we or our contractors are unable to negotiate with the labour or their\nsub-contractors, it could result in work stoppages or increased operating costs due to higher than anticipated wages\nor benefits.\nOur success is substantially dependent on our ability to recruit, train and retain skilled manpower. Our attrition\nrate of employees for six months period September 24, 2024 and Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 was\n19.84%, 13.76%, 12.67%, and 11.06%, respectively. High attrition rates lead to an increase in our training and\nrecruitment costs, which may have an adverse impact on our profitability and financial condition. High attrition\nand competition for manpower may limit our ability to attract and retain the skilled manpower necessary for us to\nmeet our future growth requirements. There can be no assurance that skilled manpower will continue to be\navailable in sufficient numbers and at wages suitable to our requirements.\nWe are also subject to a number of labour laws that protect the interests of workers, including legislation that sets\nforth detailed procedures for dispute resolution and employee removal and legislation that imposes financial\nobligations on employers upon retrenchment. If labour laws become more stringent, it may become more difficult\nfor us to maintain flexible human resource policies, discharge employees or downsize, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. While\nthere has been no such event in the past, we cannot assure you that such event will not occur in future.\n15. There have been certain delay in payment of our statutory dues. Any delay in timely payment of statutory dues\nmay expose us to penalties from the regulators.\nOur Company is required to comply with various laws including law in respect of provident fund, professional\ntax, income tax act, etc. and is required to pay various statutory dues. Details of employees covered under such\nlegislations are as provided in below table. In the past, there have been instances of delays in the remittance\ntowards the payment of these statutory dues including employee provident fund contributions on account of human\nerrors. The details of employees covered and defaults there in are reproduced in below table for the period\nspecified therein:\n(Amounts are in ₹ million)\nParticulars Six months period ended Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNo. of Paid Delaye No. of Delaye Delaye No. of Paid Delaye No. of Paid Delaye\nemploy (Amou d employ d d employ (Amou d employ (Amou d\nees nt) Amoun ees Amoun Amoun ees nt) Amoun ees nt) Amoun\nt t t) t t\nProvident 79 1.27 - 61 1.64 - 49 2.68 - 48 2.39 0.01\nFund\nTDS on 79 0.14 0.24 61 0.25 0.11 49 0.24 - 48 0.25 -\nsalaries\nProfession 79 4.41 - 61 4.95 0.04 49 5.02 0.02 48 3.95 0.04\nTax\nWhile we have addressed these issues, we cannot guarantee that similar delays or delays in payment of other\nstatutory dues will not occur in the future. Such delays could result in penalties, interest charges, or other legal\nactions by the relevant authorities, which could adversely impact our financial performance and reputation.\n16. Our registered office and operating facilities are situated on the leased land, any termination of lease may\n38\nimpact our operations.\nOur registered office and operating facilities are situated on lands leased from GIDC. In case of any termination\nof the lease, we may have to relocate our registered office and operating facilities. For further details of our\nproperties, please see section titled “Our Business -Properties” on page 205. Further, there can be no assurance\nthat we will not face any disruption of our rights as a lessee and that such lease agreements will not be terminated\nprematurely by the lessor. While no such disruptions have Any early termination or any disruption of our rights\nas lessee will adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\n17. We work with hazardous materials and activities in our operation can be dangerous, which could cause injuries\nto people or property.\nOur business requires individuals to work with hazardous materials, under potentially dangerous circumstances\n(such as being exposed to heated materials or with flammable materials. If improperly handled, heated metal can\nhurt our employees or other persons, and cause damage to our properties and the properties of others. Despite\ncompliance with requisite safety requirements and standards, our operations are subject to significant hazards,\nincluding explosions, fires, mechanical failures and other operational problems, inclement weather and natural\ndisasters and other environmental risks. While we have not experienced any such significant hazards in the past\nwhich caused any personal injury or destruction to property. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life\nor destruction of property and equipment as well as environmental damage, loss or shutting down of our facilities\ncould disrupt our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and\nreputation. We could also face claims and litigation filed on behalf of persons alleging injury predominantly due to\noccupational exposure to hazards at our facilities. If these claims and lawsuits, individually or in aggregate, are\nresolved against us, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely\naffected.\n18. A downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and\nour ability to raise capital in the future.\nThe credit ratings assigned to us and our borrowing facilities could change based upon, among other things, our\nresults of operations and financial condition. As of date of this DRHP our ratings are ‘CRISIL A-/Stable (long\nTerm rating), CRISIL A2+ (short term rating). These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating\nagencies, and we cannot assure you that any rating will not be downgraded or withdrawn by a rating agency in\nthe future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations to\nbuy, sell or hold the equity securities. If any credit rating agencies lowers our credit ratings or places us in “watch\nlist” for a possible downgrading or lowering or otherwise indicates that its outlook for that rating is negative, it\ncould have a material adverse effect on our costs and availability of capital, which could in turn have an adverse\neffect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to raise capital in the future.\n19. We are subject to quality requirements and any product defect issues or failure by us or our raw material\nsuppliers to comply with quality standards may lead to the cancellation of existing and future orders, recalls or\nwarranty and exposure to potential product liability claims.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product defects and subsequent liability claims if the use of any\nof our products results in personal injury or property damage. We may not be able to meet regulatory quality\nstandards in India or abroad, or the quality standards imposed by our customers or concerned entity in respect of\nISO 14001:2015 and ISO 9001: 2015 certifications applicable to our manufacturing processes, which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If any of our\nproducts do not meet regulatory standards or are defective, we may be, inter alia, (i) responsible for damages\nrelating to any defective products, (ii) required to replace, recall or redesign such products or (iii) incur significant\ncosts to defend any such claims. There have been certain instances in the past where we were required to replace\ncertain products not meeting the requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that we will comply\nor can continue to comply with all quality requirement standards of our customers in the future.\nOur failure to achieve or maintain compliance with regulatory requirements or quality standards may disrupt our\nability to supply products sufficient to meet demand until compliance is achieved or, with a component supplier,\nuntil a new supplier has been identified and evaluated. There is no assurance that our products will always meet\nthe satisfaction of our customers’ quality standards. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could cause\nadverse consequences to be imposed on us, including warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, the refusal\nof regulatory authorities to grant approvals, delays, suspensions or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation,\n39\nseizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, all of which could harm our\nbusiness.\n20. While our Promoters collectively have over six decades of experience, we are dependent on them and our KMP\nfor our operations and performance. The loss of or our inability to attract or retain such persons could\nmaterially adversely affect our business performance.\nOur Promoters, Shyamsundar Rathi and Shailesh Rathi have more than four decades and two decades of\nexperience, respectively in the Winding and Conductivity Products industry. The involvement of our Promoters\nin our operations, including through strategy, direction and customer relationships have been integral to our\ndevelopment and business and the loss of any of our Promoters may have a material adverse effect on our business\nand prospects.\nOur business and the implementation of our strategy is dependent upon our promoters and KMP, who oversee our\nday-to-day operations, strategy and growth of our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to\nretain these personnel or find adequate replacements in a timely manner, or at all. We may not be able to hire and\ntrain replacement personnel immediately when qualified personnel terminate their employment with our\nCompany. We may also be required to increase our levels of employee compensation more rapidly than in the\npast to remain competitive in attracting employees that our business requires. If one or more members of our KMP\nand SMP are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, such persons would be difficult to replace\nin a timely and cost-effective manner, and our business, prospects and results of operations could be materially\nadversely affected.\nIn addition, our success in expanding our business will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract, retain and\nmotivate skilled personnel. While we have experienced technical, finance and commercial teams, we may not be\nable to continuously attract or retain such personnel, or retain them on acceptable terms, given the demand for\nsuch personnel. The loss of key personnel or our inability to replace key personnel may restrict our ability to grow,\nto execute our strategy, to raise the profile of our brand, to raise funding, to make strategic decisions and to manage\nthe overall running of our operations, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations, financial position and cash flows.\n21. The objects of the Fresh Issue and deployment of funds are based on management estimates and have not been\nappraised by any external independent agency. There is no assurance that our expansion and existing plans\nwill be successful.\nWe intend to use the Net Proceeds from the Offer for the purposes described in “Objects of the Offer” on page\n95. These expansion and existing plans will result in additional costs of investment towards purchase of machinery\nand equipment in fixed assets and new equipment as well as additional working capital requirements. In the event\nthat we fail to achieve a sufficient level of revenue or manage our costs efficiently, our future financial\nperformance may be materially and adversely affected. The objects of the Fresh Issue and deployment of funds\nhave not been appraised by any external agency or any bank or financial institution or any other independent\nagency and are based on management estimates. While a monitoring agency will be appointed for monitoring\nutilization of the Net Proceeds, the proposed utilization of Net Proceeds is based on our current business plan,\nmanagement estimates, prevailing market conditions and other commercial considerations, which are subject to\nchange and may not be within the control of our management. Based on the competitive nature of our industry,\nwe may have to revise our business plan and/ or management estimates from time to time and consequently our\nfunding requirements may also change. Our internal management estimates may exceed fair market value or the\nvalue that would have been determined by third party appraisals, which may require us to reschedule or reallocate\nour project and capital expenditure and may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations and cash flows.\nOur Company, subject to applicable laws, will have flexibility to deploy the Net Proceeds. Further, pending\nutilization of Net Proceeds towards the Objects of the Offer, our Company will have the flexibility to deploy the\nNet Proceeds and to deposit the Net Proceeds temporarily in deposits with one or more scheduled commercial\nbanks included in Second Schedule of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, as may be approved by our Board or IPO\nCommittee. Accordingly, prospective investors in the Offer will need to rely upon our management’s judgment\nwith respect to the use of Net Proceeds.\n22. We are yet to place orders for equipment proposed to be funded through this Offer. In the event of any delay\nin placing the orders, or in the event the vendors are not able to provide the equipment in a timely manner, or\n40\nat all, it may result in time and cost over-runs and our business, results of operations, financial condition and\ncash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe are yet to place orders for the entire portion of the total capital expenditure which we propose to fund from\nthe Net Proceeds. We have not entered into any definitive agreements to utilize the Net Proceeds for these objects\nof the Offer and have relied on the quotations received from third parties for estimation of the cost, the TEV report\nissued by Dun & Bradstreet Information Services (India) Private Limited on December 26, 2024. The completion\nof such projects is dependent on the performance of external agencies, which are responsible for inter alia civil\nwork, procurement and installation of machinery and supply and testing of equipment. If the performance of these\nagencies is inadequate, it may result in incremental cost and time overruns which could adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations. We may also be unable to identify suitable replacement external agencies in a\ntimely manner. In addition, the actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ from our\nestimates as a result of, among other things, unforeseen delays or cost overruns, unanticipated expenses, regulatory\nchanges, engineering design changes and technological changes.\nThe quotations received by us for such plant and machinery as of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus\nare valid for a certain period of time and may be subject to revisions and other commercial and technical factors.\nAdditionally, in the event of any delay in placement of orders, the proposed schedule, implementation and\ndeployment of the Net Proceeds may be extended or may vary accordingly. We cannot assure you that the actual\ncosts incurred in relation to any of the Objects will be similar to and not exceed the amounts indicated in any third\nparty quotations as on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. The terms of certain quotations, also specify\nthat the prices in such quotations are subject to variation during the validity period pursuant to policy changes and\nchanges in the price list/raw materials of the vendors. If there is any increase in the costs of equipment, additional\ncosts will need to be borne by our Company from its internal accruals. As a result, there can be no assurance that\nwe will be able to undertake such capital expenditure within the cost indicated by such quotations or that there\nwill not be cost escalations. Our inability to procure such machinery and equipment at acceptable prices or in a\ntimely manner, may result in an increase in capital expenditure, the proposed schedule implementation and\ndeployment of the Net Proceeds may be extended or may vary accordingly, thereby resulting in an adverse effect\non our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n23. Any variation in the utilization of the Net Proceeds shall be subject to certain compliance requirements,\nincluding prior approval of the shareholders of our Company.\nWe propose to utilize the Net Proceeds towards (i) funding capital expenditure requirements for setting up new\nproject in our subsidiary viz. ALCU and (ii) repayment/prepayment, in full or part, of all or certain outstanding\nborrowings availed by our Company. For further details, see section titled “Objects of the Offer” beginning on\npage 95. The planned use of the Net Proceeds is based on current conditions and is subject to changes in external\ncircumstances, costs, other financial conditions or business strategies. The deployment of the Net Proceeds is\nbased on our current business plan, management estimates, current circumstances of our business, quotations\nreceived from vendors and suppliers, prevailing market conditions and other commercial and technical factors,\nand has not been appraised by any bank, financial institution or other independent party. These estimates may be\ninaccurate, and we may require additional funds to implement the purposes of the Offer. Accordingly, at this stage,\nwe cannot determine with any certainty if we would require the Net Proceeds to meet any other expenditure or\nfund any exigencies arising out of the competitive environment, business conditions, economic conditions or other\nfactors beyond our control. Any delay in our schedule of implementation may cause us to incur additional costs.\nSuch time and cost overruns may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and\ncash flows. In accordance with the Companies Act, 2013, and the SEBI ICDR Regulations, we cannot undertake\nvariation in the utilization of the Net Proceeds as disclosed in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus without obtaining\nthe approval of the shareholders through a special resolution. In the event of any such circumstances that require\nus to vary the disclosed utilization of the Net Proceeds, we may not be able to obtain the approval of the\nshareholders in a timely manner, or at all. Any delay or inability in obtaining such approval of the shareholders\nmay adversely affect our business or operations. Further, in the event that there is such a change in the objects of\nthe Offer, our Promoters would be required to provide an exit opportunity to the dissenting shareholders as\nprovided for in the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the conditions and manner prescribed under Schedule\nXX of the SEBI ICDR Regulations and applicable law. Additionally, the requirement on Promoters to provide an\nexit opportunity to such dissenting shareholders of our Company may deter our Promoters or controlling\nshareholders from agreeing to the variation of the proposed utilization of the Net Proceeds, even if such variation\nis in the interest of our Company. Further, we cannot assure you that our Promoters will have adequate resources\nat their disposal at all times to enable them to provide an exit opportunity to dissenting shareholders. In light of\nthese factors, we may not be able to vary the objects of the Offer to use any unutilized proceeds of the Fresh Issue,\n41\nParticulars For the six months Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nperiod ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024\nNet cash (used\nin)/generated from\nOperating activities (455.12) 21.63 375.35 (158.72)\nNet cash (used\nin)/generated from\ninvesting activities (5.53) (36.79) (56.49) (80.79)\nif any, even if such variation is in the interest of our Company. This may restrict our ability to respond to any\nchange in our business or financial condition by re-deploying the unutilized portion of Net Proceeds, if any, which\nmay adversely affect our business, financial conditions, cash flows and results of operations.\n24. Our Company has negative cash flows from its operating activities and investing activities in the past years,\ndetails of which are given below. Sustained negative cash flow could impact on our growth and business.\nOur Company had negative cash flows from our operating activities and investing activities as per the Restated\nConsolidated and Standalone Financial Information and the same are summarized as under:\n(₹ in million)\nParticulars For the six months Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nperiod ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024\nNet cash (used (455.12) 21.63 375.35 (158.72)\nin)/generated from\nOperating activities\nNet cash (used (5.53) (36.79) (56.49) (80.79)\nin)/generated from\ninvesting activities\nWe may experience negative cash flows in the future as well. Negative cash flows over extended periods, or\nsignificant negative cash flows in the short term, could materially impact our ability to operate our business and\nimplement our growth plans. This situation may have an adverse effect on our cash flows, business, future\nfinancial performance and results of operations.\nFor more information, see “Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” on page 300.\n25. We may not be successful in implementing our strategies, which could materially adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and prospects.\nThe success of our business depends greatly on our ability to effectively manage our business and implement our\nstrategies. For details, see section titled “Our Business” on page 184. We will require significant capital\ninvestments and cash outlays, which is likely to have a material impact on our results of operations. Our ability to\nsuccessfully execute these expansion plans will depend on various factors, including, among others:\n• the availability, terms and costs of financing;\n• the grant of regulatory approvals; and\n• general economic conditions in such markets.\nTo achieve and maintain future growth, we need to, inter alia, effectively manage our expansion projects,\naccurately assess new markets, attract new customers, obtain sufficient financing for our expected capital\nexpenditures, control our input costs, effectively expand, train and manage our employees, maintain sufficient\noperational and financial controls and make additional capital investments to take advantage of anticipated market\nconditions. We may not be able to achieve growth in revenues and profits or maintain such rate of growth in the\nfuture. Moreover, if we experience extended periods of very rapid growth, we may not be able to manage our\ngrowth effectively with available resources. If we are unable to execute our strategies effectively, and in a timely\nand successful manner, our business, financial condition and profitability will be adversely affected.\n26. Our financing agreements contain covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business. If we are not\nin compliance with certain of these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers from the respective lenders,\nour lenders may accelerate the repayment schedules, and enforce their respective security interests, leading to\na material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our outstanding borrowings on a consolidated basis was ₹ 1,427.20 million. For further,\ninformation, please see section titled "Financial Indebtedness" on page 328. Some of our financing arrangements\ncontains restrictive covenants. We are required to obtain prior written consent from our lenders for, among other\n42\nmatters, changing our capital structure or composition of our management or Board of Directors, issuance of\nfurther Equity Shares, etc. If we are not in compliance with certain of these covenants and are unable to obtain\nwaivers from the respective lenders or if any events of default occur, our lenders may accelerate the repayment\nschedules or terminate our credit facilities. Subsequently, if we are unable to pay our debt, affected lenders could\nalso proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. Till date we have not defaulted\nin payment of any loan, however we cannot assure you that such default may not occur in future.\nIf our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources become insufficient to pay our debt obligations\nor our contractual obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to sell assets or attempt to\nrestructure or refinance our existing indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on\nthe condition of the capital markets, our financial condition at such time and the terms of our other outstanding\ndebt instruments. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with\nmore onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt\ninstruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments\nof interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our\ncreditworthiness or credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable\nterms.\n27. Certain sections of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus contain information from CareEdge Report, which has\nbeen commissioned and paid for by our Company and any reliance on such information for making an\ninvestment decision in the Offer is subject to inherent risks.\nCertain sections of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus include information based on, or derived from, the CareEdge\nReport or extracts of the CareEdge Report prepared by CARE Analytics and Advisory Private Limited., which is\nnot related to our Company, Directors or Promoters.

Please see section titled “Industry Overview” on page 124.\n28. Our failure to identify and understand evolving industry trends and preferences and to develop new products\nto meet our customers’ demands may materially adversely affect our business.\nChanges in clients preferences, regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render\ncertain of our products obsolete or less attractive. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory\nstandards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis is a significant\nfactor in our ability to remain competitive. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the\nnecessary technological knowledge that will allow us to develop our product portfolio in this manner. If we are\nunable to obtain such knowledge in a timely manner, or at all, we may be unable to effectively implement our\nstrategies, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Moreover, we cannot assure you\nthat we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive or\nthat certain of our products will not become obsolete. We are also subject to the risks generally associated with\nnew product introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development\nand failure of products to operate properly.

Any dispute with such supplier\nmay lead to interruption in our supplies of raw materials.\ne) While our revenues are growing pan-India across 20 states/union territories, however, our revenue is\nconcentrated in western India.

Any slowdown in these sectors may impact\nour business.\ng) Since our incorporation in the year 1981, we have expanded our business, scale of operations and delivered\nvariety of products, creating our position in the winding and conductivity products.

We may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers or may be unsuccessful in\nmanaging the effects of raw material price fluctuations. While in the past no such event has occurred, we cannot\nassure you that such event will not occur in future. In case, such event occurs it may impact business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. For further details, see\nsection titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Cost\nand availability of raw materials” on page 304.\nThe prices and supply of these primary raw materials are also affected by, among others, general economic\nconditions, competition, production costs and levels, transportation costs, indirect taxes and import duties, tariffs\nand currency exchange rate. Further, as we source our raw materials from third parties, our supply chain may be\ninterrupted by circumstances beyond our control. Poor quality roads and other transportation-related infrastructure\nproblems, inclement weather and road accidents may disrupt the transportation of raw materials.\nWhile we usually maintain sufficient inventory for all our primary raw materials. While we have not faced any\ninstances of shortage of raw materials during six months ended September 30, 2024 and Fiscals 2024, 2023 and\n2022, we cannot assure you that we will not face such instances in the future. In case we face shortage of raw\nmaterials, we may not be able to manufacture our products according to our pre-determined time frames, at our\npreviously estimated product costs, or at all, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash\nflows and reputation.\n11. While we export our products to over 20 countries across 5 continents, our inability to handle risks associated\nwith our export sales could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries.\nDuring six months ended September 30, 2024 and Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, we exported our products to over\n20 countries across 5 continents including United States of America, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Australia, Canada,\nEgypt, Singapore, etc. Details of revenue from export during six months period ended September 30, 2024 and\nFiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n(₹ in million)\n36\nParticulars For the six month Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nperiod ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmount Amount % of Amount % of Amount % of Amount % of\nrevenue revenue revenue revenue\nfrom from from from\noperation operation operation operation\nExports 757.44 10.04 1,617.89 13.64 1,867.17 18.46 1,343.14 14.72\nParticulars For the six month Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nperiod ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmount % of Amount % of Amount % of Amount % of\nrevenue revenue revenue revenue\nfrom from from from\noperation operation operation operation\nExports 757.44 10.04 1,617.89 13.64 1,867.17 18.46 1,343.14 14.72\nOur exports are subject to risks that are specific to each country and region in which we export goods, as well as\nrisks associated with exports in general. Our exports are subject to, among other risks and uncertainties, the\nfollowing demand of our products, local economic and political conditions, compliance with foreign laws and\nexchanges rates.\nIn addition, we may not perform as expected in international markets, because our competitors and the established\nplayers in these markets may have a more established presence and have more experience in operating in such\nmarket, which could allow them to have better relationships with distributors and consumers, gain early access\nto information regarding attractive sales opportunities and, in general, be better placed to launch products with\nother advantages of being a first mover.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,\ncash flows and prospects.\n12. We are subject to pre-qualification and pre order audit by some of our customers. In case our operating\nfacilities do not meet the customers’ requirements, we may not get orders from our customers.\nWe are subject to inspection and audit by our customers. The customers assess our operating facilities, as per their\nparameters. Typically, as a part of the process, customers officials visit our plant to conduct an on-site evaluation\nand verify the operating processes to assess whether it meets their standards. Further, we require UL approval for\nour supplies to United States of America. In case, we are not able to retain or renew this approval, it may adversely\naffect our business and results of operations. Additionally, the customers also assess other critical factors relevant\nto their requirements. Based on the inspection/audit findings, the orders are placed by the customers. Meeting the\nrequirements of the customers during such inspection and audit are essential for our operations. The pre-\nqualification process may involve additional cost for us. There have been instances where post audit/inspection\nthe customers have not placed order with us. In case, customers do not place order with us, it will impact our\noperations and financials.\n13. While we manufacture a majority portion of our products for sale based on confirmed orders under direct\narrangements, however, if there are any fluctuations in the demand for our products, it could affect our\ninventory levels, operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWhile we manufacture a majority portion of our products for sale based on confirmed orders under direct\narrangements, however, if there is any fluctuations in the demand for our products, it could affect our inventory\nlevels, operations, financial condition and cash flow. Our future earnings through the sale of our products may not\nbe realized as forecasted, due to cancellations or modifications of firm orders or our failure to accurately prepare\ndemand forecasts. If we are unable to appropriately estimate the demand for our products for any reason, it could\nresult in excess inventory levels or the unavailability of our products during increased demand, resulting in loss in\npotential sales. Our ability to accurately forecast customer demand for our products is affected by various factors,\nincluding:\n• a substantial increase or decrease in the demand for our products or for similar offerings of our competitors;\n• changes in customer requirements;\n• aggressive pricing strategies employed by our competitors;\n• failure to accurately forecast or changes in customer acceptance of our products;\n• limited historical demand and sales data for our products in newer markets;\n• fluctuations in foreign currencies; and\n• weakening of general economic conditions or customer confidence that could reduce the sale of our\nproducts.\n37\nParticulars Six months period ended Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNo. of Paid Delaye No. of Delaye Delaye No. of Paid Delaye No. of Paid Delaye\nemploy (Amou d employ d d employ (Amou d employ (Amou d\nees nt) Amoun ees Amoun Amoun ees nt) Amoun ees nt) Amoun\nt t t) t t\nProvident\nFund 79 1.27 - 61 1.64 - 49 2.68 - 48 2.39 0.01\nTDS on\nsalaries 79 0.14 0.24 61 0.25 0.11 49 0.24 - 48 0.25 -\nProfession\nTax 79 4.41 - 61 4.95 0.04 49 5.02 0.02 48 3.95 0.04\nInventory levels that exceed customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs or we may be\nrequired to sell our excess inventory at discounted prices, which will adversely affect our results of operations. On\nthe other hand, if we face demand in excess of our production, we may not be able to adequately respond to the\ndemand for our products. This could result in delays in delivery of our products to our customers and we may suffer\ndamage to our reputation and customer relationships. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our\ninventories at optimum levels to successfully respond to customer demand. While we have not faced any situation\nin six months period ended September 30, 2024 and Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022, we cannot assure you that such\ninstance will not occur in future.\n14. We operate in a manpower intensive industry and are subject to labour laws and any strike, work stoppage or\nincreased wage demand by our employees or any other kind of disputes with our employees or high attrition\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating processes are labour intensive in nature. As on December 31, 2024, we employ 133 permanent\nemployees and 385 contractual employees. If we or our contractors are unable to negotiate with the labour or their\nsub-contractors, it could result in work stoppages or increased operating costs due to higher than anticipated wages\nor benefits.\nOur success is substantially dependent on our ability to recruit, train and retain skilled manpower. Our attrition\nrate of employees for six months period September 24, 2024 and Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 was\n19.84%, 13.76%, 12.67%, and 11.06%, respectively. High attrition rates lead to an increase in our training and\nrecruitment costs, which may have an adverse impact on our profitability and financial condition. High attrition\nand competition for manpower may limit our ability to attract and retain the skilled manpower necessary for us to\nmeet our future growth requirements. There can be no assurance that skilled manpower will continue to be\navailable in sufficient numbers and at wages suitable to our requirements.\nWe are also subject to a number of labour laws that protect the interests of workers, including legislation that sets\nforth detailed procedures for dispute resolution and employee removal and legislation that imposes financial\nobligations on employers upon retrenchment. If labour laws become more stringent, it may become more difficult\nfor us to maintain flexible human resource policies, discharge employees or downsize, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. While\nthere has been no such event in the past, we cannot assure you that such event will not occur in future.\n15. There have been certain delay in payment of our statutory dues. Any delay in timely payment of statutory dues\nmay expose us to penalties from the regulators.\nOur Company is required to comply with various laws including law in respect of provident fund, professional\ntax, income tax act, etc. and is required to pay various statutory dues. Details of employees covered under such\nlegislations are as provided in below table.

Our registered office and operating facilities are situated on the leased land, any termination of lease may\n38\nimpact our operations.\nOur registered office and operating facilities are situated on lands leased from GIDC. In case of any termination\nof the lease, we may have to relocate our registered office and operating facilities. For further details of our\nproperties, please see section titled “Our Business -Properties” on page 205. Further, there can be no assurance\nthat we will not face any disruption of our rights as a lessee and that such lease agreements will not be terminated\nprematurely by the lessor. While no such disruptions have Any early termination or any disruption of our rights\nas lessee will adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\n17. We work with hazardous materials and activities in our operation can be dangerous, which could cause injuries\nto people or property.\nOur business requires individuals to work with hazardous materials, under potentially dangerous circumstances\n(such as being exposed to heated materials or with flammable materials. If improperly handled, heated metal can\nhurt our employees or other persons, and cause damage to our properties and the properties of others. Despite\ncompliance with requisite safety requirements and standards, our operations are subject to significant hazards,\nincluding explosions, fires, mechanical failures and other operational problems, inclement weather and natural\ndisasters and other environmental risks. While we have not experienced any such significant hazards in the past\nwhich caused any personal injury or destruction to property. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life\nor destruction of property and equipment as well as environmental damage, loss or shutting down of our facilities\ncould disrupt our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and\nreputation. We could also face claims and litigation filed on behalf of persons alleging injury predominantly due to\noccupational exposure to hazards at our facilities. If these claims and lawsuits, individually or in aggregate, are\nresolved against us, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely\naffected.\n18. A downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and\nour ability to raise capital in the future.\nThe credit ratings assigned to us and our borrowing facilities could change based upon, among other things, our\nresults of operations and financial condition. As of date of this DRHP our ratings are ‘CRISIL A-/Stable (long\nTerm rating), CRISIL A2+ (short term rating). These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating\nagencies, and we cannot assure you that any rating will not be downgraded or withdrawn by a rating agency in\nthe future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations to\nbuy, sell or hold the equity securities. If any credit rating agencies lowers our credit ratings or places us in “watch\nlist” for a possible downgrading or lowering or otherwise indicates that its outlook for that rating is negative, it\ncould have a material adverse effect on our costs and availability of capital, which could in turn have an adverse\neffect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to raise capital in the future.\n19. We are subject to quality requirements and any product defect issues or failure by us or our raw material\nsuppliers to comply with quality standards may lead to the cancellation of existing and future orders, recalls or\nwarranty and exposure to potential product liability claims.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product defects and subsequent liability claims if the use of any\nof our products results in personal injury or property damage. We may not be able to meet regulatory quality\nstandards in India or abroad, or the quality standards imposed by our customers or concerned entity in respect of\nISO 14001:2015 and ISO 9001: 2015 certifications applicable to our manufacturing processes, which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If any of our\nproducts do not meet regulatory standards or are defective, we may be, inter alia, (i) responsible for damages\nrelating to any defective products, (ii) required to replace, recall or redesign such products or (iii) incur significant\ncosts to defend any such claims. There have been certain instances in the past where we were required to replace\ncertain products not meeting the requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that we will comply\nor can continue to comply with all quality requirement standards of our customers in the future.\nOur failure to achieve or maintain compliance with regulatory requirements or quality standards may disrupt our\nability to supply products sufficient to meet demand until compliance is achieved or, with a component supplier,\nuntil a new supplier has been identified and evaluated. There is no assurance that our products will always meet\nthe satisfaction of our customers’ quality standards. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could cause\nadverse consequences to be imposed on us, including warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, the refusal\nof regulatory authorities to grant approvals, delays, suspensions or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation,\n39\nseizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, all of which could harm our\nbusiness.\n20. While our Promoters collectively have over six decades of experience, we are dependent on them and our KMP\nfor our operations and performance. The loss of or our inability to attract or retain such persons could\nmaterially adversely affect our business performance.\nOur Promoters, Shyamsundar Rathi and Shailesh Rathi have more than four decades and two decades of\nexperience, respectively in the Winding and Conductivity Products industry. The involvement of our Promoters\nin our operations, including through strategy, direction and customer relationships have been integral to our\ndevelopment and business and the loss of any of our Promoters may have a material adverse effect on our business\nand prospects.\nOur business and the implementation of our strategy is dependent upon our promoters and KMP, who oversee our\nday-to-day operations, strategy and growth of our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to\nretain these personnel or find adequate replacements in a timely manner, or at all. We may not be able to hire and\ntrain replacement personnel immediately when qualified personnel terminate their employment with our\nCompany. We may also be required to increase our levels of employee compensation more rapidly than in the\npast to remain competitive in attracting employees that our business requires. If one or more members of our KMP\nand SMP are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, such persons would be difficult to replace\nin a timely and cost-effective manner, and our business, prospects and results of operations could be materially\nadversely affected.\nIn addition, our success in expanding our business will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract, retain and\nmotivate skilled personnel. While we have experienced technical, finance and commercial teams, we may not be\nable to continuously attract or retain such personnel, or retain them on acceptable terms, given the demand for\nsuch personnel. The loss of key personnel or our inability to replace key personnel may restrict our ability to grow,\nto execute our strategy, to raise the profile of our brand, to raise funding, to make strategic decisions and to manage\nthe overall running of our operations, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations, financial position and cash flows.\n21. The objects of the Fresh Issue and deployment of funds are based on management estimates and have not been\nappraised by any external independent agency. There is no assurance that our expansion and existing plans\nwill be successful.\nWe intend to use the Net Proceeds from the Offer for the purposes described in “Objects of the Offer” on page\n95. These expansion and existing plans will result in additional costs of investment towards purchase of machinery\nand equipment in fixed assets and new equipment as well as additional working capital requirements. In the event\nthat we fail to achieve a sufficient level of revenue or manage our costs efficiently, our future financial\nperformance may be materially and adversely affected. The objects of the Fresh Issue and deployment of funds\nhave not been appraised by any external agency or any bank or financial institution or any other independent\nagency and are based on management estimates. While a monitoring agency will be appointed for monitoring\nutilization of the Net Proceeds, the proposed utilization of Net Proceeds is based on our current business plan,\nmanagement estimates, prevailing market conditions and other commercial considerations, which are subject to\nchange and may not be within the control of our management. Based on the competitive nature of our industry,\nwe may have to revise our business plan and/ or management estimates from time to time and consequently our\nfunding requirements may also change. Our internal management estimates may exceed fair market value or the\nvalue that would have been determined by third party appraisals, which may require us to reschedule or reallocate\nour project and capital expenditure and may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations and cash flows.\nOur Company, subject to applicable laws, will have flexibility to deploy the Net Proceeds. Further, pending\nutilization of Net Proceeds towards the Objects of the Offer, our Company will have the flexibility to deploy the\nNet Proceeds and to deposit the Net Proceeds temporarily in deposits with one or more scheduled commercial\nbanks included in Second Schedule of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, as may be approved by our Board or IPO\nCommittee. Accordingly, prospective investors in the Offer will need to rely upon our management’s judgment\nwith respect to the use of Net Proceeds.\n22. We are yet to place orders for equipment proposed to be funded through this Offer. In the event of any delay\nin placing the orders, or in the event the vendors are not able to provide the equipment in a timely manner, or\n40\nat all, it may result in time and cost over-runs and our business, results of operations, financial condition and\ncash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe are yet to place orders for the entire portion of the total capital expenditure which we propose to fund from\nthe Net Proceeds. We have not entered into any definitive agreements to utilize the Net Proceeds for these objects\nof the Offer and have relied on the quotations received from third parties for estimation of the cost, the TEV report\nissued by Dun & Bradstreet Information Services (India) Private Limited on December 26, 2024. The completion\nof such projects is dependent on the performance of external agencies, which are responsible for inter alia civil\nwork, procurement and installation of machinery and supply and testing of equipment. If the performance of these\nagencies is inadequate, it may result in incremental cost and time overruns which could adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations. We may also be unable to identify suitable replacement external agencies in a\ntimely manner. In addition, the actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ from our\nestimates as a result of, among other things, unforeseen delays or cost overruns, unanticipated expenses, regulatory\nchanges, engineering design changes and technological changes.\nThe quotations received by us for such plant and machinery as of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus\nare valid for a certain period of time and may be subject to revisions and other commercial and technical factors.\nAdditionally, in the event of any delay in placement of orders, the proposed schedule, implementation and\ndeployment of the Net Proceeds may be extended or may vary accordingly. We cannot assure you that the actual\ncosts incurred in relation to any of the Objects will be similar to and not exceed the amounts indicated in any third\nparty quotations as on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. The terms of certain quotations, also specify\nthat the prices in such quotations are subject to variation during the validity period pursuant to policy changes and\nchanges in the price list/raw materials of the vendors. If there is any increase in the costs of equipment, additional\ncosts will need to be borne by our Company from its internal accruals. As a result, there can be no assurance that\nwe will be able to undertake such capital expenditure within the cost indicated by such quotations or that there\nwill not be cost escalations. Our inability to procure such machinery and equipment at acceptable prices or in a\ntimely manner, may result in an increase in capital expenditure, the proposed schedule implementation and\ndeployment of the Net Proceeds may be extended or may vary accordingly, thereby resulting in an adverse effect\non our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n23. Any variation in the utilization of the Net Proceeds shall be subject to certain compliance requirements,\nincluding prior approval of the shareholders of our Company.\nWe propose to utilize the Net Proceeds towards (i) funding capital expenditure requirements for setting up new\nproject in our subsidiary viz. ALCU and (ii) repayment/prepayment, in full or part, of all or certain outstanding\nborrowings availed by our Company. For further details, see section titled “Objects of the Offer” beginning on\npage 95. The planned use of the Net Proceeds is based on current conditions and is subject to changes in external\ncircumstances, costs, other financial conditions or business strategies. The deployment of the Net Proceeds is\nbased on our current business plan, management estimates, current circumstances of our business, quotations\nreceived from vendors and suppliers, prevailing market conditions and other commercial and technical factors,\nand has not been appraised by any bank, financial institution or other independent party. These estimates may be\ninaccurate, and we may require additional funds to implement the purposes of the Offer. Accordingly, at this stage,\nwe cannot determine with any certainty if we would require the Net Proceeds to meet any other expenditure or\nfund any exigencies arising out of the competitive environment, business conditions, economic conditions or other\nfactors beyond our control. Any delay in our schedule of implementation may cause us to incur additional costs.\nSuch time and cost overruns may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and\ncash flows. In accordance with the Companies Act, 2013, and the SEBI ICDR Regulations, we cannot undertake\nvariation in the utilization of the Net Proceeds as disclosed in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus without obtaining\nthe approval of the shareholders through a special resolution. In the event of any such circumstances that require\nus to vary the disclosed utilization of the Net Proceeds, we may not be able to obtain the approval of the\nshareholders in a timely manner, or at all. Any delay or inability in obtaining such approval of the shareholders\nmay adversely affect our business or operations. Further, in the event that there is such a change in the objects of\nthe Offer, our Promoters would be required to provide an exit opportunity to the dissenting shareholders as\nprovided for in the Companies Act, 2013 and in terms of the conditions and manner prescribed under Schedule\nXX of the SEBI ICDR Regulations and applicable law. Additionally, the requirement on Promoters to provide an\nexit opportunity to such dissenting shareholders of our Company may deter our Promoters or controlling\nshareholders from agreeing to the variation of the proposed utilization of the Net Proceeds, even if such variation\nis in the interest of our Company. Further, we cannot assure you that our Promoters will have adequate resources\nat their disposal at all times to enable them to provide an exit opportunity to dissenting shareholders. In light of\nthese factors, we may not be able to vary the objects of the Offer to use any unutilized proceeds of the Fresh Issue,\n41\nParticulars For the six months Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nperiod ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024\nNet cash (used\nin)/generated from\nOperating activities (455.12) 21.63 375.35 (158.72)\nNet cash (used\nin)/generated from\ninvesting activities (5.53) (36.79) (56.49) (80.79)\nif any, even if such variation is in the interest of our Company. This may restrict our ability to respond to any\nchange in our business or financial condition by re-deploying the unutilized portion of Net Proceeds, if any, which\nmay adversely affect our business, financial conditions, cash flows and results of operations.\n24. Our Company has negative cash flows from its operating activities and investing activities in the past years,\ndetails of which are given below.

Negative cash flows over extended periods, or\nsignificant negative cash flows in the short term, could materially impact our ability to operate our business and\nimplement our growth plans. This situation may have an adverse effect on our cash flows, business, future\nfinancial performance and results of operations.\nFor more information, see “Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” on page 300.\n25. We may not be successful in implementing our strategies, which could materially adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and prospects.\nThe success of our business depends greatly on our ability to effectively manage our business and implement our\nstrategies. For details, see section titled “Our Business” on page 184. We will require significant capital\ninvestments and cash outlays, which is likely to have a material impact on our results of operations. Our ability to\nsuccessfully execute these expansion plans will depend on various factors, including, among others:\n• the availability, terms and costs of financing;\n• the grant of regulatory approvals; and\n• general economic conditions in such markets.\nTo achieve and maintain future growth, we need to, inter alia, effectively manage our expansion projects,\naccurately assess new markets, attract new customers, obtain sufficient financing for our expected capital\nexpenditures, control our input costs, effectively expand, train and manage our employees, maintain sufficient\noperational and financial controls and make additional capital investments to take advantage of anticipated market\nconditions. We may not be able to achieve growth in revenues and profits or maintain such rate of growth in the\nfuture. Moreover, if we experience extended periods of very rapid growth, we may not be able to manage our\ngrowth effectively with available resources. If we are unable to execute our strategies effectively, and in a timely\nand successful manner, our business, financial condition and profitability will be adversely affected.\n26. Our financing agreements contain covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business. If we are not\nin compliance with certain of these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers from the respective lenders,\nour lenders may accelerate the repayment schedules, and enforce their respective security interests, leading to\na material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our outstanding borrowings on a consolidated basis was ₹ 1,427.20 million. For further,\ninformation, please see section titled "Financial Indebtedness" on page 328. Some of our financing arrangements\ncontains restrictive covenants. We are required to obtain prior written consent from our lenders for, among other\n42\nmatters, changing our capital structure or composition of our management or Board of Directors, issuance of\nfurther Equity Shares, etc. If we are not in compliance with certain of these covenants and are unable to obtain\nwaivers from the respective lenders or if any events of default occur, our lenders may accelerate the repayment\nschedules or terminate our credit facilities. Subsequently, if we are unable to pay our debt, affected lenders could\nalso proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. Till date we have not defaulted\nin payment of any loan, however we cannot assure you that such default may not occur in future.\nIf our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources become insufficient to pay our debt obligations\nor our contractual obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to sell assets or attempt to\nrestructure or refinance our existing indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on\nthe condition of the capital markets, our financial condition at such time and the terms of our other outstanding\ndebt instruments. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with\nmore onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt\ninstruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments\nof interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our\ncreditworthiness or credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable\nterms.\n27.
